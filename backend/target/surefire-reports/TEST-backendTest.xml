The fund will offer financial assistance to the neediest NTU students who have no other recourse for help. Recipients of support from the Fund are encouraged to “pay it forward” and in so doing, the Fund will perpetuate the cycle of giving and create a culture of philanthropy so that future generations of students can continue to receive financial aid at a time of critical need.

"The NTU We Belong campaign has been all about participation and togetherness," said Ms Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President for University Advancement. "The NTU community has shown its pride in the University, and helped to advance the remarkable work being done by our students, alumni, faculty, and staff in Singapore and beyond."

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student The grad-titude of giving back From recruiting juniors and providing mentorship to sharing resources and volunteering talent, these alumni have been actively giving back to the NTU community after graduation. Text: Nur Isyana Isaman Opening doors for juniors Giving back comes in different forms and shapes. For Henry Tan (NBS/1988), the group chief executive officer of an audit and accounting firm, he hires from NTU as his way of paying it forward. “NTU graduates who joined CLA Global TS have the required skillset to adapt quickly and dive into work at our firm, which makes it easier to guide them. They also have good work ethic and the willingness to learn,” says Henry, who served on the Nanyang Business School (NBS) Alumni Advisory Board for a decade until 2022. Trusting the quality of an NTU education and the calibre of its graduates, his firm has recruited about 270 NTU alumni and students – mostly from NBS – as employees and interns since 1993. Some are groomed into key leaders at the firm. One of them is accountancy graduate, Ang Soon Lii (NBS/2005), an associate director for transformation and quality assurance. “My role requires me to constantly learn, unlearn and relearn to keep up with the evolving technological and regulatory environments. The things that helped me through these changes are a supportive working environment at the firm and the hard and soft skills I picked up as a student,” says Soon Lii.  Henry (left) and his NTU accountancy junior turned employee, Ang Soon Lii.  Similarly, Chua Yuxuan (WKWSCI/2015), the head of creator partnerships at SGAG, has seen his company hire about 20 graduates from his alma mater over the past eight years. He says: “The NTU curriculum adapts well to industry changes. With their skillset, NTU graduates who satisfy the job criteria usually end up in the final rounds of our interviews.”  Chua Yuxuan (second row, first from right) with his work team members, including three graduates from NTU. Echoing the sentiment is Su Weixiang (CEE/2011), the general manager of the Singapore arm of a Danish shipping company, Lauritzen Bulkers. Weixiang – who holds a Bachelor of Science in Maritime Studies from the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) – describes NTU graduates as “knowledgeable and passionate, with solid performance and attitude”. The CEE Young Alumni Award 2023 recipient has employed 17 of his juniors as full-time staff since joining the company in 2010. Under Weixiang’s leadership, his company has been supporting NTU as a term bursary sponsor since 2011 to uplift underprivileged students. Su Weixiang is the general manager of J. Lauritzen Singapore, which employs NTU graduates. Providing mentorship Besides offering employment opportunities to his juniors, Weixiang also serves on the CEE Mentorship Programme, where he mentors undergraduates to bridge the needs and expectations between academia and industry. Likewise, alumnus Ang Ker Ser (MAE/2001) has been mentoring those younger than him. Since joining the NTU Alumni Toastmasters Club in 2014, Ker Ser has imparted his public speaking, leadership and professional skills to the club members including new alumni. He was also among the pioneer batch of mentors for the NTU Alumni Mentorship Programme in 2020. Meanwhile, Henry provides mentorship to young, aspiring entrepreneurs through an annual business plan challenge organised by his firm for university students. During the challenge, students present their business plans to gather feedback from judges comprising successful entrepreneurs and leading business professionals. Henry (first from right) awards the winning team from NTU at CLA Global TS’ fifth Business Plan Challenge. Sharing resources Despite his schedule at SGAG, Yuxuan contributed as a guest speaker at an NTU alumni event, where he shared resources and tips on content creation and working in the creative field. For alumna Alicia Sok Hourng (NBS/2009), who is the co-founder of Hotel Himawari Apartments in Cambodia, her way of giving back is by offering her property as a venue for alumni events. She also provides NTU undergraduates with mentorship and internship opportunities at her property. The Nanyang Alumni Service Award 2023 recipient is also the secretary general of NTU Alumni Association (Cambodia), which she helped to launch in 2017. Volunteering talent Liu Runan emceed for an NTU event in Shenzhen in September 2023. While Alicia taps on her tangible resources, Liu Runan (SSS/2015) uses her emceeing talent for NTU events, such as the China Alumni Conference 2023 in Shenzhen. Runan is also the secretary general of the NTU Alumni Association (Guangdong), where she hosted the launch of the NTU Technology Transfer Centre-South Centre (Zhuhai) and the Nanyang International Innovation Valley. Another China-based alumnus, Qu Feng (NBS/2009), finds joy in organising business networking events for fellow alumni, such as the third NTU Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai Alumni Forum as well as the fifth China Alumni Association Forum. The NBS graduate has served the NTU Alumni Association (Shanghai) – the first of its kind in China – since 2009 as an executive committee member and vice president. In 2019, Feng stepped up to lead the NTU Alumni Association (Heilongjiang).   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/the-grad-titude-of-giving-back'}, IndexData{title='NTU Alumni Regional Conference 2023 | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

This isn’t a group of accomplished individuals, but just one person – Johnny Widodo, the man behind the incredible 10-ton bus-pulling feat at NTU Alumni Homecoming 2023. "People say I'm out of my mind. I know it’s entertaining but there’s a deeper message. You know that thing you can’t do? With motivation and discipline, you’ll be able to achieve what you thought was impossible,” says Johnny, whose journey in fitness started when he realised the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle after his late mother had a stroke in 2005. Johnny with his late mum when he received his bachelor's degree on his convocation day at NTU. Truly, the secret of this multihyphenate’s success is focus, motivation and discipline in all aspects of his life, from his career to his personal pursuits. Often dubbed “The Strongest CEO in Indonesia”, Johnny has two decades of experience in start-ups and industries ranging from fintech and e-commerce to aquaculture and manufacturing. He has also led several companies in Indonesia, and today, he is the CEO of a financial services enabler, Ringan Technology Indonesia. As someone who has successfully scaled the corporate ladder, Johnny finds satisfaction in sharing his experience with the next generation of entrepreneurs and fellow NTU alumni. “When I became the top man in the company, I developed a desire to be more well-rounded. I wanted something that would give me a sense of achievement in my personal life. So I consciously stepped up my strongman training as well as my efforts in sharing my expertise through mentoring, a podcast, books and NTU alumni activities,” he explains, adding that making an impact on other people’s lives gives him a sense of happiness and accomplishment. Being part of the NTU alumni network and President of NTU Alumni Association (Indonesia) has helped him to expand his business network and opened doors beyond NTU circles. Johnny (fourth from left) at an NTU alumni event in Jakarta. “Through the alumni network, I’ve made friends with people outside of NTU, like from the other universities in Singapore and even people from the Singapore government, embassies and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce & Industry,” says Johnny, who also sits on the Nanyang Business School Alumni Advisory Board. Finding success is about seizing the moment as well, and saying “yes” to opportunities that come your way, such as agreeing to pull a bus for the NTU community. Over dinner at an NTU alumni event in Jakarta in August this year, Johnny pulled out his phone to show Prof Ooi Kim Tiow, NTU Associate Provost (Alumni), a TikTok video of himself pulling a bus, leading Prof Ooi to invite him to repeat the feat in NTU. Johnny’s close ties with his alma mater meant there was only going to be one answer. “I’ve only been in two schools throughout my life,” says Johnny with a laugh. “My first one from kindergarten to high school, and NTU where I got all my three degrees.” After receiving his bachelor's degree in materials engineering with first class honours from NTU in 2002, Johnny stayed on to complete a master’s in the same discipline two years later. When he decided to take an MBA in 2008, NTU was the natural choice, though the fact that he could study part time and the quality of NTU’s professors helped make his mind up. Johnny receiving his third degree - an MBA - from the university. One of the highlights of his time at NTU was during his MBA stint when he led an NTU team to Montreal, Canada, for the prestigious John Molson MBA International Case Competition in 2010. “We were like a bunch of stooges,” jokes Johnny. “We were the dark horse and never really thought we had a chance to win. Unexpectedly, we went all the way to the finals and had to change the dates of our return flights and extend our hotel stay. I remember being on the phone with Assoc Prof Chung Lai Hong, the director of Nanyang MBA, who was very excited for us and offered all her support.” His team were the first Asian team to ever make the finals of the competition and eventually finished third. “Yes, we were the first team to fly the NTU flag in Canada for this competition,” beams Johnny. "Be proud to be an NTU alumnus and be a brand ambassador for NTU. And as an alumnus, don’t just ask ‘what’s in it for me?’. Think about how you can contribute to the university too." - Johnny Widodo Click here to watch Johnny showcase his incredible strength.      Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/might-and-mindset'}, IndexData{title='Strengthening the French connection | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Strengthening the French connection Marine Dejoux, a French tech engineer with two master’s degrees, talks about her connectedness with Singapore and how she taps it to engage fellow NTU alumni in France as she presides over the country’s alumni association. By Nur Isyana Isaman Marine Dejoux (TIP/2019) lives and works in Paris but her mind frequently wanders to her second home, Singapore, where she attended high school and pursued postgraduate studies.  Holder of a master’s degree from a leading digital engineering school, the Télécom SudParis, a member of the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, she then decided to pursue a Master of Science in Technopreneurship & Innovation (MSc TIP) at NTU Entrepreneurship Academy in 2018. “My dream was to complement my technological background with another qualification oriented around entrepreneurship because I believe that an entrepreneurial approach is essential to succeeding in technological projects,” said Marine. Marine attended the Singapore French School from 2007 to 2012 while her father worked in Southeast Asia, developing a sense of belonging and connectedness to Singapore, which grew deeper after she returned to France.    Marine Dejoux holds two master’s degrees, including the Master of Science in Technopreneurship & Innovation from NTU. Describing herself as an engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset, Marine currently works as a tech product owner at VeepeeTech, one of Europe’s leading e-commerce platforms. “I like to innovate in complex and impactful projects. Currently, I manage two technical teams comprising ten members of different nationalities to improve information systems while taking charge of relations with clients and transversal teams.” “A similarity between France and Singapore is the strong technological culture. My key takeaway from living in Singapore and pursuing the master’s degree at NTU is that diversity brings different perspectives to the table, which enables any team to innovate continuously, win, and go further,” said Marine, who was a class representative involved in organising social events after school hours. Marine (first row, sixth from right) with her classmates from the MSc TIP programme. As a cosmopolitan citizen who has lived in Australia, France and Singapore, Marine can speak four languages: French, English, Spanish, and basic Mandarin. She first took Mandarin classes in Singapore during her teens and continued studying it when she returned to France. “I still return to Singapore and would meet my friends from NTU over a meal in hawker centres. My favourite dishes in Singapore are chicken rice and chilli and black pepper crab,” she shared. Connecting with NTU Marine applies her learning points from NTU not just in her career but also in giving back to her alma mater. As the first President of NTU Alumni Association (France), Marine leads an active committee of members from multicultural backgrounds. The other committee members are Arvind Hurboseea (SCSE/2002), Stephanie Zhao (NBS/2016), Huang Xiaochao (MAE/2010), and Deepak Subramanian (SCSE/2011). “The story of the NTU Alumni Association (France) started 12 years ago with Lionel Vincke (NBS/2011), who coordinated the NTU Alumni Circle in France with success. Since graduating from NTU in 2019, I helped Lionel organise alumni gatherings,” said Marine. Marine receiving a token of appreciation from NTU Deputy President and Provost, Prof Ling San, at the launch of NTU Alumni Association (France) held in Paris in July 2023. The NTU Alumni Association (France) was formed in May 2023 and officially launched in July. The event was graced by NTU Deputy President and Provost, Prof Ling San; the Singapore Ambassador to France, Ms Foo Teow Lee; and representatives from top French educational partners.  According to Marine, half of the association’s 300 members are French citizens selected for student exchange programmes at NTU. The other half are mostly Asian graduates from the Master of Business Administration programme at Nanyang Business School, who live in France to pursue professional opportunities and personal commitments. “NTU is becoming quite well-known in France, thanks to the postgraduate and undergraduate exchange programmes with top French universities, especially in engineering and business. I have regular insightful discussions with students who studied in Singapore for such programmes,” she said. Under her leadership, Marine hopes to connect NTU with France's diverse ecosystems, build stronger partnerships between the two countries she holds close to her heart, and bring the association to greater heights.  Members of the NTU Alumni Association (France) with NTU staff and invited guests at the launch event. “We aim to connect and unite our alumni community living in France through quarterly events, such as business discussions, social networking, and sharing of exclusive NTU-related opportunities. We may be far away from the campus, but the memories alumni had forged while studying at NTU bonded us together, and this motivates me to organise learning and networking events for the group. I am excited to be meeting them again at our next social event in October,” said Marine. Besides France, NTU alumni in other parts of Europe can reach out to alumni associations in  Germany , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom , respectively.   Photo Credits: Marine Dejoux National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/strengthening-the-french-connection'}, IndexData{title='I did not submit my paper to DR-NTU, why is my paper available in DR-NTU? - NTU Ask A Librarian', content='Toggle menu visibility NTU Library FAQ 0 options available.

Students can also earn verified certificates for completed courses which serve to validate new skills and knowledge acquired. NTU students who enrol in NTU’s pre-approved list of MOOCs offered by the world’s top universities may also have the credits transferred to their programme to fulfil their Major PE, GER PE or GER UE/BDE requirements. In order to do so, students would need to take note of the following when signing up for the MOOC.   Enrolling in MOOC If you are a current NTU student, register for an account with the MOOC platform using your NTU email address. If you are a freshman who has not yet matriculated at NTU, you may register using your personal email address. Subsequently when you have matriculated at NTU, you may re-register using your NTU email address. Currently, there are 3 MOOC platforms that you may sign up for - Coursera, edX and FutureLearn. As NTU is a partner university of Coursera, you could register for a Coursera Campus account ( https://www.coursera.org/programs/coursera-for-ntu-students-iasyo ) using your NTU email to obtain free certificate for certain courses.  Courses with free certification are listed under ‘Courses pre-approved for NTU Credit Transfer’ in the above hyperlink.   Applying for Credit Transfer Upon completing the course, you may apply for credit transfer via Student Intranet > Academic Matters > Study Programmes, Curriculum Plan and Credit Transfer > MOOC – Apply Credit Transfer.  The application must include the eCertificate of Completion, welcome email which shows the enrolment date, as well as a reflection report on what you have learnt from the course.

Transferred credits will be recorded with a Pass notation in either Semester 1 or Semester 2 only. If you are on semester leave, you will not be able to apply for MOOC credit transfer whilst on leave. You can only do so in the semester when you resume studies.

Read more Toggle notification Toggle search Toggle menu NTU Welcomes Indonesian International Student Mobility Awardees I am a/an... Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student For the second year running, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU) continues its partnership with the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to host the awardees of the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA). IISMA is a prestigious scholarship scheme that funds Indonesian students for mobility programmes at world-renowned universities worldwide. Awardees enter a rigorous selection process and are exceptional in the areas of academics and co-curricular involvements. Through cross-cultural immersion, the programme aims to equip students with essential competencies to be future-ready global citizens: cultural intelligence, leadership, collaboration, cognitive flexibility, and inter-disciplinary learning. NTU welcomed 24 and 25 IISMA students in AY21/22 and AY22/23 respectively to her campus.  Each cohort of students spent one semester undertaking full-time NTU undergraduate courses in various disciplines, ranging from Sciences and Engineering, to Business, Humanities and more. During their time here, the NTU-IISMA students were each assigned to a mentor within their area of study. Through this, students were able to obtain both academic guidance and industry insight. Aside from core classroom activities, students were encouraged to expand their learning by participating in co-curricular activities outside and within the campus community. Students got a glimpse into our uniquely Singaporean identity through educational tours organized by NTU's Office of Global Education and Mobility (OGEM) to the National Gallery (April 2022) and Singapore’s Cultural and Heritage Sites (August 2022). Another key feature of the NTU-IISMA collaboration is the industry tour where students visited the Nanyang Environment & Water Research Institute (NEWRI) and the NEWater (PUB) facilities and gained first-hand insights into the latest developments in sustainability research in Singapore.     The NTU-IISMA collaboration is a strategic initiative designed to enhance international cooperation efforts and strengthen links between NTU and Indonesia. In line with this, Ms Pauline Ho, the Deputy Director of OGEM, said, "IISMA is an inspiring programme by the Indonesian government as it sets to broaden the global perspective of Indonesian students, allow them to network and build lifelong regional friendships and opportunity to enhance their competence needed for Industrial 4.0. NTU students too, have benefited from the interaction within and outside of classrooms with IISMA students and learn much from working within a multi-cultural team to solve real world SDG issues. We hope to see more of such opportunities to be part of the journey to groom future talents to be Global Savvy and Future Ready.”".

Embark on a Journey with us As one of NTU’s leading Premier Scholars Programmes, NTU-USP is a vibrant and unique programme specially designed to offer outstanding students global learning opportunities that complement their core areas of study.

NTU-USP scholars will be also be challenged to sharpen their critical thinking skills and leadership abilities through interdisciplinary academic and co-curricular programmes promoting independent learning and immersive cultural experiences. #whyNTUUSP Our Identity: A multi-disciplinary programme that complements NTU’s core disciplines. Our Goals: Develop independent thinkers. Nurture empathetic leaders. Foster engaged community. Encourage global citizenship. Low Yong Zhou, Class 2023, Accountancy & Business My NTU-USP journey was truly a transformative one. Looking back, NTU-USP offered countless opportunities to expand my horizons abroad and a nurturing environment to grow and develop holistically. Each takeaway from the inspiring faculty and peers I met on this journey has shaped me into the person I am today. Ang Wan Qi, Class of 2022, Environmental Earth Systems Science NTU-USP classes prompted me to delve deeper into a variety of social and philosophical issues. As a science student, the NTU-USP experience has proven to be a valuable supplement to my academic journey and has contributed significantly to my overall development. The curriculum equipped me with a well-rounded perspective and a solid foundation that enables me to explore diverse topics beyond my primary field of study even after graduation. Lim Jia Yi, Class 2021, Linguistics and Multilingual Studies My NTU-USP experience is shaped by the little moments - sneaking in Koufu dinners during our 4.30pm classes, late nights studying together at the Crespion canteen, debating over AI ethics one day and the next on which theme would work best for our annual Back2School event, and so much more. These little moments were made extraordinary with the warm and supportive community here at NTU-USP. They gave me both the courage to try new things (like running for club president in my final year!) and comfort in knowing that these friends are for life. Thung Yi Tian, Class of 2020, Physical and Mathematical Sciences The NTU-USP curriculum has provided me with a deep perspective on a broad range of topics, equipping me with soft skills to master any knowledge beyond my discipline. The cohesive and motivated student community has been crucial in giving me support during and well beyond my undergraduate journey, pushing me to strive for excellence in my pursuits. Ng Xinyu, Class of 2019, Communication Studies The NTU-USP community has been my greatest takeaway from university. I've been blessed with countless opportunities to develop myself as a leader, hold meaningful and intellectual discussions with my peers, broaden my perspectives with trips overseas and learn from passionate professors. For anyone looking for a holistic environment to develop themselves and learn from the sharpest of minds and kindest of hearts in the community, NTU-USP is the place to be. Kwang Yi Jing, Class of 2018, Accountancy & Business While the scholarship offers impressive monetary benefits, I benefited most from the programme's ability to bring together a group of intelligent, like-minded, and driven individuals. It forged a community that felt very much like home. It provided a network and sounding board to call upon, when needed. Most importantly, being around my peers - many of whom are more talented and accomplished than I am - inspired daily self-reflection and improvement. It pushed me to strive for more. 4 years later, I can safely say I have achieved more today because of NTU-USP. Low Zhi Hong, Class of 2017, ​Aerospace Engineering ​The NTU-USP experience has stretched my intellectual capacity and broadened my perspectives of the world – well beyond the scope of my engineering degree. Of all, I am utmost thankful to be part of a student community which is highly self-driven, capable and very supportive. My peers have continuously inspired me to strive for greater success in university and beyond. Lek Yan Ru, Class of 2016, Sociology Participating in the NTU-USP was a transformative experience, blending diverse disciplinary exploration with the privilege of engaging with humble yet brilliant minds. Till now, I fondly recall the Summer Programme, which included USP students, other participants from NTU and two other foreign universities - this experience was unqiue and enriching. I'm deeply grateful for the NTU-USP journey, which has provided me with great exposure and supportive lifelong friends :) Publications and Collateral Access the archives of our circulated digital newsletters over the years.

The fund will offer financial assistance to the neediest NTU students who have no other recourse for help.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Show me more results Published on 19 Jul 2023 Spearheading greater financial inclusion in Indonesia’s digital era Melisa Hendrawati, the Chief Financial Officer of an Indonesian bank focused on digital banking, shares why she champions financial inclusion ahead of the inaugural NTU Alumni Regional Conference on 26 August 2023. By Sadia Roohi Melisa Hendrawati (NBS/2007 & 2011) wears many hats. The Nanyang Business School alumna is not only the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Superbank but is also a member of the boards of Global Association of Risk Professional (Indonesia Chapter) and Chartered Financial Analyst Society in Indonesia. She is also active in the NTU Alumni Association of Indonesia, serving over 1,400 alumni in the capacity of Vice President.  Melisa Hendrawati, Chief Financial Officer of Superbank in Indonesia, completed both her undergraduate and postgraduate studies at NTU’s Nanyang Business School. Having built a successful career in the financial services sector, she will be sharing her observations of Indonesia’s digital economy and e-commerce landscape at the upcoming NTU Alumni Regional Conference in Jakarta on 26 August 2023 as a panel speaker.  Apart from being the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s digital economy, which includes e-commerce, online travel, edutech and digital payments, is also the largest in the region. In 2022, the country recorded US$77 billion in gross merchandise value, and this figure is projected to double to US$130 billion by 2025, according to a report titled “e-Conomy SEA” issued by Google, Temasek, and Bain & Company.  “Indonesia can be considered as one of the most exciting digital banking markets in Southeast Asia. As our digital economy continues to thrive, fuelled by technological advancements and changing consumer behaviours, it presents an exciting landscape for businesses, entrepreneurs, and individuals to harness the transformative power of the digital age,” said Melisa.  She highlights the potential of the digital banking sector in Indonesia, especially given the country's tech-savvy population and high smartphone penetration. "However, almost 80% of the Indonesian population remains unbanked or underbanked," she points out.  Recognising the need for greater financial inclusion, Melisa emphasises the role of digital banks in bridging gaps in financial access. “The loan-to-GDP ratio in Indonesia is only around 35%, compared to more than 190% in Singapore. Helping people to access financing is a real pain point that Superbank is trying to solve by leveraging our ecosystem,” she said. Superbank is backed by Emtek Group, Grab and Singtel, and is undergoing a digital transformation to utilise technology and data insights to offer more digital banking services and solutions to the underbanked group of micro businesses and retail customers.   Relishing her Singapore-Indonesia connections Melisa’s deep connection with Singapore, where she completed two degrees and built her career for 10 years before returning to Indonesia in 2014, holds a special place in her heart.  “Singapore, being a melting pot of great talent, has significantly shaped my adaptability and willingness to embrace change,” she said.  Reflecting on her time at NTU, Melisa describes her Convocation as a turning point, when she realised that her journey has just begun. She made a personal commitment to pursue postgraduate studies, ideally at NTU.  Her dream came true when she later returned to NTU to pursue the Nanyang MBA programme and was awarded the Dean's List upon her completion in 2010. She finds that her undergraduate and postgraduate studies at NTU have played a pivotal role in shaping her character, fostering resilience, and instilling adaptability. Alumni in Indonesia gather for the NTU Alumni Association (Indonesia) Annual General Meeting on 16 March 2023.  “Studying at NTU provided me with invaluable opportunities," said Melisa. "The diversity in cohort mates and best-in-class curriculum allowed me to engage in discussions with both lecturers and classmates, honing my ability to solve issues with innovative solutions.” When asked about her vision in her current role as a CFO, Melisa said, “I have always wanted to make a difference to people's lives. Fittingly, my role is about expanding financial services to reach the underserved community.” She has also faced challenges, such as establishing robust systems and processes from scratch as well as recruiting the right people to propel the bank's growth.  Melisa believes that challenges always bring greater opportunities. She said, “People are the greatest asset of every company. No challenge is insurmountable if we have a solid and motivated team.”  She draws inspiration from Simon Sinek, a British-born American author and inspirational speaker, to lead with heart and empathy and to lead by example.  The value of networking Being involved in various co-curricular activities during her university days has helped Melisa develop her leadership and soft skills. She finds that networking with fellow NTU alumni has a positive impact on her personal and professional life. Anytime she needs to brainstorm ideas and exchange insights, she will turn to the alumni network. Furthermore, the friendship she has forged amongst NTU alumni is one that will last a lifetime, providing a valuable support system.   Melisa (2nd from right) is the Vice President of NTU Alumni Association (AA) (Indonesia). She is seen here with AA President Johnny Widodo (centre) and other members of the management committee.  She said, “An alumni association is a great platform for all alumni to share their insights with others and to network and grow together.” Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, NTU’s alumni association in Indonesia had successfully organised a series of webinars, and it plans to host more in-person events, networking sessions and gatherings. Melisa looks forward to meeting fellow alumni and industry players to discuss the opportunities and challenges in Indonesia's digital economy during a panel session at the NTU Alumni Regional conference, where she will also shed light on building a strong corporate culture by combining innovation and a digital mindset. Sign up for the NTU Alumni Regional Conference 2023 which incorporates the NTU Singapore – Indonesia Dialogue on Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship. There will also be an NTU Singapore Graduate Programme Recruitment Roadshow happening from 25 to 26 August 2023.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student A campus committed to changing the world NTU stands at the forefront of sustainability efforts, conducting pioneering research and fostering the next wave of environmental stewards – as highlighted in a documentary series produced with Mediacorp. Text: Lester Kok NTU School of Computer Science and Engineering alumnus Dr David Woon, who is also the Co-Director of the Continental-NTU Corporate Lab, is leading the revolution in autonomous vehicles and smart technologies that can help cities like Singapore reduce its carbon emissions. Among the many projects at the joint corporate lab, Corriere is an electric food delivery robot that could one day move autonomously and self-sufficiently through traffic, and in future, work in a coordinated fleet to deliver food and goods. “These technologies may usher in the era of electric vehicles, which in turn would help in climate change,” says Dr Woon. The lab’s works were showcased in “Our World to Change”, a three-part documentary series on NTU’s sustainability efforts that aired on CNA and on Channel 5, and is still available on demand on meWATCH and on the NTUsg YouTube channel. Like Dr Woon, many NTU graduates continue to champion sustainability after graduation. NTU graduate Louisa May Fung, currently an Environmental, Social, and Governance Analyst, emphasises her role in ensuring projects align with local and global sustainability benchmarks. In her interview with CNA, she credits NTU for equipping her with the skills that are enabling them to make an impact on the world: “I want to be able to promote sustainability and bring about positive outcomes for the environment," says Louisa, 25, who graduated from the Asian School of the Environment in 2021. Photo clockwise from left: Dr David Woon (SCSE/2001), Louisa May Fung (ASE/2021) and Celine Ng (SBS/2021) are alumni fighting for the environment. Fellow Class of 2021 graduate from the School of Biological Sciences, Celine Ng, is also an ardent sustainability advocate working at a venture capital firm that invests in promising agrifood tech start-ups. I feel really inspired to be able to drive real impact in the food industry, and even dream of completely revolutionising and changing the food system," says the 26-year-old. Across all schools and research institutes, NTU is also a powerhouse when it comes to sustainability education and innovation. Students are taught important topics related to sustainability in the Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core curriculum while the University has recently partnered with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research to set up a centre in Singapore, to train government leaders and policymakers in Asia Pacific. Engineering students also get the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in building electric cars for the future which boosts their employability in related sectors while others are commercialising new innovations that can change the world. "NTU aspires to be a global leader in sustainability. We aim to lead by example and demonstrate habits and behaviours to reduce our carbon footprint." – Prof Ho Teck Hua, NTU President   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/a-campus-committed-to-changing-the-world'}, IndexData{title='Institutes and Centres', content='Donate Now Your gift will have a positive impact on students of NTU and every dollar given goes directly towards the area of support designated by you.  * For NTU faculty and staff, please click  here  if you would like to donate via monthly salary deduction.  * Please click here for NTU’s privacy statement.

Use up and down arrows to browse available options and enter to select one. Search Much depends on the film title. Unlike scholarly books and journals, films are generally not produced for the academic market. There are only a few established sales/distribution channels for academic institutions and libraries to purchase video content or license rights online streaming or viewing. In addition, film producers these days are less inclined to produce DVDs, choosing instead to distribute via online retailers that only sell direct to individuals. For example, companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Vimeo do not sell subscriptions to institutions. Films are usually distributed by geographic region, and in line with country specific laws governing the classification and distribution of films. In Singapore, we have the Films Act governing any sale or distribution of films. For academic libraries, there are only a handful of established video streaming platforms. NTU Library is current using: Kanopy (when you browse, you may see 0 results, but please scroll down) These platforms have an international outlook—they negotiate and supply videos to various countries around the world, including to Singapore. They have quite a good number of documentaries. If the chosen film is available in either of these streaming video platforms with the corresponding geographical rights, i.e. available for Singapore market, NTU Library can purchase/subscribe after ensuring there is no issue with the film classification. If the chosen film is not available in these platforms, which is often the case for most commercial or drama titles, there is only a small possibility that we may be able to get a streaming video license. The entire process includes: Searching for and contacting the rights owner or distributor, e.g. the Director, Producer, Film Production House, or distribution agents Liaising with the distributor on the possibilities of supplying to NTU a streaming video license, and negotiating for an acceptable pricing Processing the license (contracts, terms and conditions, etc.) Purchasing admin (purchase requests, approvals, etc.) Getting the video file, uploading and testing of the video From start to end, the process could take around two to six months. Typically it is difficult to ascertain the rights owner or distributor as the films distribution industry can be considered rather private and exclusive. Even when we manage to track them, communicating with them and getting them to consider supplying a specific streaming video license to the University is usually laborious. Such special arrangements usually translates into high costs for the license. Because of the complexity, difficulties and high costs associated with streaming video licenses, NTU Library will only consider requests for streaming videos for teaching purposes.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Venture capitalist Tan Lip-Bu gifts NTU Singapore S$3 million to support its first AI professorship NTU, 17 Jun Mr Tan Lip-Bu, the chairman of venture capital firm Walden International and an alumnus of NTU Singapore’s predecessor Nanyang University, has pledged a gift of S$3 million to his alma mater to set up a new professorship in artificial intelligence (AI). The professorship is the first in the field of AI to be established at NTU Singapore. It aims to attract the best and brightest minds to support the advancement of research and education at NTU’s College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS), which was set up earlier this year to spearhead the University’s AI initiatives. Mr Tan announced his gift during his visit to the NTU campus on 14 June, where he was given a brief on the University’s programmes and research ambitions in AI.    NTU President Professor Ho Teck Hua, who is also the Founding Executive Chairman of AI Singapore, said: “The University is grateful to Mr Tan Lip-Bu for the generous gift to his alma mater to support AI research and education. The gift will significantly boost our ability to attract world-class talent and nurture AI scientists who can develop impactful, human-centric solutions to benefit society. It will also support Singapore’s goal of becoming a major AI hub in the world. Lip-Bu’s act of paying it forward is inspirational – I hope it will encourage more alumni to do the same.” Mr Tan Lip-Bu, who received his Bachelor of Science from Nanyang University, said: “NTU will always have a special place in my heart because it is where I received my foundation undergraduate education. Having spearheaded over 500 deep-tech start-ups globally, I see immense potential in AI. I hope my contribution will pave the way for more breakthrough AI solutions from NTU that will change the world.” Aside from his role at Walden International, Mr Tan is the Founding Managing Partner of Celesta Capital and Walden Catalyst Ventures, with over $5 billion under management. With over three decades of venture capital experience, his success has been recognised globally by various awards and rankings, including being named to the Forbes’ Midas List, an annual ranking that recognises the world’s top 100 tech investors. Boosting NTU’s AI ambitions The new professorship will support a world-class academic in AI for a five-year tenure at NTU’s CCDS. Aside from catalysing cutting-edge AI research, the faculty member appointed to the professorship will also help NTU attract top researchers, faculty and postdoctoral students to the University.  Professor Luke Ong, Vice President (AI & Digital Economy) and Dean of CCDS, said: “AI is set to be the main engine that drives the digital economy, making top AI talent critical as we continue to advance research, development and the application of AI technologies for societal good. The professorship will help draw the best talent to NTU, fostering a vibrant ecosystem that encourages innovation, accelerates interdisciplinary research, and creates a thriving environment to groom future generations of AI talent.” CCDS will also foster collaboration between computing and other disciplines through various research platforms, such as the Generative AI Lab, which is concerned with both the theory and practice of generative AI; and the Centre for DSAI-4-X, which will catalyse interdisciplinary research and education relating to data science and AI, and develop new interdisciplinary areas of scientific inquiry using AI.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student All You Need To Know About NTU CoHASS – Flexible Curriculum, Overseas Experience & Double Majors Think of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and engineering courses probably come to mind. But one of its largest colleges is the College of Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences (CoHASS). You may not have heard of it but you’re sure to be familiar with its schools, like the School of Art, Design and Media, School of Humanities, School of Social Sciences, and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. They’re known to be the artsier side of NTU but that’s not all there is. Diverse courses aside, you can expect perks like flexible curriculum and double major programmes. Here’s all you need to know about NTU CoHASS: 1. Flexible curriculum to suit your aspirations The module catalogues for CoHASS courses are extensive. For example, the Bachelor of Communication Studies one is about 41 pages long. Thankfully, there’s no need to take every single class in order to graduate. Instead, students get the opportunity to select the modules they want to do during their years at NTU. A flexible curriculum allows students to take on modules they have interest in. Image credit: NTU CoHASS This is great for those who have a specific interest or are planning to go into a particular field after graduation for those interested in Communication Studies. You’ll start off with fundamentals to firm up your foundation but from Semester 2 onwards, you have free rein to choose more specialised modules. There is a wide variety of modules spanning topics like TV and film, advertising, public relations, journalism and even media research. So, if you’re thinking of a career in journalism, you can take modules like Print & Digital Publications, Photojournalism and Online Journalism and skip the ones that focus on data mining or media research. These offer a better insight into the journalism industry, and prepare you for when you step into the working world. This flexibility is, of course, not limited to just Communication Studies. Other courses under CoHASS also offer students the opportunity to mix and match modules to pursue the education they want. The Bachelor of Social Sciences in Psychology, for example, lists over 50 courses, but you can choose electives according to your interests, whether it’s child psychology or neuroscience. 2. Semesters abroad with partner universities Living independently while soaking in a foreign culture are just a couple of the perks that come with getting to study abroad. If you’ve wanted a taste while still studying full time in Singapore, NTU CoHASS has options for students to continue their university education overseas with their global exchange programme. Up to 70% of students from CoHASS go for an overseas curricular experience, thanks to the flexibility of the programmes. You’ll have the flexibility to clear your elective modules during your exchange programme  Image credit: NTU CoHASS You’ll have access to partner universities in more than 40 countries, including the US, UK, Korea, and even Sweden. By heading to a partner university, you’ll get your academic credits transferred back to NTU. That means not having to take on extra modules to complete your degree. You’ll even get these modules on your transcript upon graduation. 3. Double and second majors to fast-track career paths Socks aren’t the only good things that come in pairs. Majors also come in twos at NTU CoHASS. When enrolling, you can opt to do a double major, such as in English & Philosophy, or History & Chinese. These are offered to undergraduates who have an interest in more than one field of study but aren’t sure which major or degree they should take.  Take up minors or second majors to pursue your interests Image credit: NTU CoHASS But since courses at CoHASS are so pliable, don’t worry about missing out on your chance to do a second major after you’ve been accepted. Apart from having the flexibility to choose your electives, you can also go for a minor, second major or even take up more electives to deepen your studies in your first major. The workload for a double major or second major programme is definitely heavier. But don’t let that hinder you from pursuing your academic dreams of studying what interests you, like in English & Philosophy, or History & Chinese. Such programmes can even fast track you onto specific career paths too, like with Psychology and Media Analytics. Studying both disciplines could help you in getting a career in behavioural science or even UX/UI design. 4. A variety of language courses so you can branch out overseas If you’ve ever wanted to work in a non-English speaking country, knowing how to speak the native language would be a plus point to have on your resume. As students of NTU CoHASS, you get the opportunity to learn a second or even third language as part of your curriculum. Picking up another language can be useful for branching out overseas Image credit: NTU CoHASS There are 16 Asian and European languages you can choose from, but the most popular include Japanese, Korean, French and German. Students can even take Arabic, Spanish and even Singapore Sign Language as well. These classes don’t just cover the basics like greetings and commonly used phrases. The structured lessons and progressive levels prepare students to take official proficiency tests. These are a common requirement when applying for work visas overseas. Plus, the lessons also offer a glimpse into different cultures as well. This means you won’t just be fluent by the end of the course, you’ll also be able to integrate yourself seamlessly overseas. 5. Guaranteed internships to gain work experience Internships are a simple yet effective way to apply the knowledge you’ve gained in class in the real world. And at NTU CoHASS, all students will  do at least one internship as part of your course. This is in comparison to many other universities where only the top students are given internships. Directly apply concepts you’ve learned in class during hands-on internships Image credit: NTU CoHASS However, NTU CoHASS makes internships compulsory. Students are placed in vetted companies that are compatible with your course of study. This means you won’t be getting a shady one that will ask only for coffee and errand runs, but reputable companies that will ensure you’re putting your skills to good use. With internships, you’ll be getting a head start against your peers in gaining work experience. This, in turn, may help improve your employability after graduation. CoHASS has a good track record, with more than nine in 10 graduates from the class of 2021 finding employment within six months of their final exams.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/all-you-need-to-know-about-ntu-cohass'}, IndexData{title='Making e-commerce accessible to all in Vietnam | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Making e-commerce accessible to all in Vietnam Sendo is one of the leading e-commerce players in Vietnam. Its founder, Tran Hai Linh, an alumnus of NTU, is reshaping how locals shop. In June, he will speak about AI’s impact on consumers and e-businesses at an upcoming NTU Alumni Regional Conference. By Sadia Roohi Tran Hai Linh graduated from NTU’s Nanyang Business School in 2005 with a business degree in marketing. Little did he know that his education would lay the groundwork for his future endeavours in the tech industry. Fast forward to today, Linh is the co-founder and CEO of Sendo Technology JSC, one of the most prominent online marketplace platforms in Vietnam, which serves more than 20 million customers and has 300,000 registered merchants. Tran Hai Linh (NBS/2005), co-founder and CEO of Sendo Technology JSC, one of the most prominent online marketplace platforms in Vietnam. Photo credit: Sendo Sendo was established in 2012 with 30 staff members as Linh and his co-founders saw a growing potential in e-commerce in Vietnam. "The e-commerce landscape in Vietnam has changed drastically in the last decade. It has become commonplace for consumers to purchase almost everything from online platforms. We saw an opportunity to create a platform that would revolutionise how Vietnamese consumers interacted with online marketplaces," Linh explains. However, being in the business of innovation, Linh is aware that finding the right solution at the right time is one of the biggest challenges. “Changing people’s behavior is hugely rewarding, but at the same time, you need all the prerequisite conditions to be met. Knowing when is the right time to go in with a new and innovative product is definitely most important,” he said. Recognising the challenges faced by those residing in rural areas, where access to quality and affordable products is often limited, Sendo wanted to bridge this divide. Understanding that first-time buyers in rural areas usually purchase daily essentials rather than big-ticket items, Sendo tailored its product offerings to cater to this group at accessible price points. The e-commerce player also introduced a Cash on Delivery (COD) service through Vietnam Post in areas where electronic payments were not commonly accepted.  “By addressing the unique challenges faced by rural communities, Sendo not only provided access to diverse goods but also promoted economic growth in these areas,” said Linh. Linh (far left) and colleagues at a Sendo warehouse.  Sendo has grown to a company of 500 employees with plans to be listed in the next few years. Linh said he has always hired alumni from NTU because he believes in the calibre of NTU graduates.  For himself, Linh took up a tuition fee loan to study at NTU in 2002 and was active in the NTU Vietnamese Students’ Club. The 41-year-old reminisces fondly about his time at NTU, where he honed his business acumen and forged lifelong connections. The father of three boys plans to bring his eldest son to visit the NTU campus, hoping that his son will one day become an NTU student.  (Left) Linh and his team participated in the 2004 NTU Business Plan Competition, an experience he said formed the foundation for his startups later on.  (Right) Linh with Indonesian NTU student, Dei, at the NTU International Culture and Food Festival in 2004 which was jointly organised by the international student bodies in NTU. Both were members of the organising committee.  “At NTU, I received the best of both worlds. On one hand, I was able to access the best business education that helped prepare me for the demands of the business world. On the other hand, I was immersed in the environment of technology, with friends from various technological disciplines. This put me on the trajectory of my career, from running the computing hardware business for Lenovo in Vietnam and Indochina to creating my first mobile app company to the establishment of Sendo,” said Linh, who received the Nanyang Outstanding Young Alumni Award in 2020. With crisis comes opportunity Linh's strategic foresight steered the company through uncharted waters, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic when supply chains were disrupted. While other players pulled back, Sendo expanded and launched “Sendo Farm”, an online grocery service, in 2021.  "As the world grappled with unprecedented challenges, we saw an opportunity to make a meaningful difference. One key moment was when our first Sendo Farm warehouse opened exactly in the week Ho Chi Minh City went into lockdown. Since then, Sendo Farm has seen great acceptance across the country, and we intend to make online grocery shopping the next big project for us in this decade,” said Linh.  Many Vietnamese would spend half an hour travelling on their motorbikes to the local markets daily, and Linh proposes an alternative for them.  “They can order fresh produce online from Sendo Farm. We are an online supermarket which purchases directly from the suppliers and delivers them to our customers, saving them the trouble of travelling,” he said.  Linh expressed that there is fulfillment in serving millions of people through Sendo’s service. He mentioned that the actions taken by him and his team every day have an impact on the lives of their customers, as well as the livelihoods of their partners and their families.  Fusing AI into e-commerce  Looking ahead, Linh envisions Sendo playing an even more integral role in shaping Vietnam's e-commerce landscape. "The future of e-commerce in Vietnam is brimming with potential," Linh says.  As technology evolves, he believes businesses which can identify the right technologies to solve real-life problems will win the market share.  Linh advises aspiring entrepreneurs looking to venture into the tech sector to be brave, bold, and humble to learn.  “Never before have consumers had more choices, power, and access to information. The more customisable the services are, the more engaged the customers would be, and hence give business owners more business – and this is where AI comes into use to customise solutions,” explained Linh. At the upcoming NTU Alumni Conference in Hanoi , he will share his insights during the panel discussion on "AI & Data Analytics: Shaping the Future of Business in Southeast Asia".  “In innovation, the biggest challenge is finding a new way of doing things to convenience your customers so they are willing to change their behaviours. In turn, the business will profit from that change,” added Linh. Linh will speak at the Conference about how artificial intelligence will impact consumers’ way of life in the next five years.  Sign up for the NTU Alumni Regional Conference 2024 , happening in Hanoi, Vietnam, on 22 June 2024, where alumni business leaders will come together to discuss topics on economic growth, AI and innovation.  Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/making-e-commerce-accessible-to-all-in-vietnam'}, IndexData{title='Grant Calls | Centre for Research and Development in Learning (CRADLE) | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Sandra Davie Senior Education Correspondent   A: NTU, as a world-class research and teaching university, has a lot to offer. Let’s start with its standing and reputation worldwide, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade. NTU is one of the world’s leading universities, based on the QS World University Rankings and other independent global indices, including those by Times Higher Education and the US News and World Report, all of which include NTU in the top 40. It is especially useful to look at subject rankings. You will notice that NTU features regularly in the top 10 in various global subject rankings. This includes the fields of artificial intelligence, engineering, materials science, and communication and media studies. I would suggest that you visit the NTU campus with your son and talk to the students there. Its smart campus is impressive and a testament to the transformative experience that students have had there. It is called a smart campus because it is a living test bed for some of the latest technologies, including self-driving electric buses and food delivery robots. I have been advising students on the importance of interdisciplinary learning, and NTU has embarked on it in a big way. It introduced the Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core (ICC) in August 2021 that makes it a requirement for students to take seven courses from the core curriculum. Students from different disciplines are put together in small groups to discuss and present their views on different topics, which range from social media regulation to sustainability. This creates an environment where students continuously interact with peers outside their discipline and develop social networks that eventually become their source of intellectual inspiration and creativity. Students are also encouraged to deepen their knowledge beyond their chosen majors through electives, minors and second majors in areas from entrepreneurship and environmental sustainability to data analytics and economics. NTU has also increased its interdisciplinary degree offerings, such as the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) degree programme, which has been listed among the top 10 AI and data science undergraduate courses globally by Forbes. Professor Ling San, NTU’s acting president and provost, said the aim is to train students to tackle real-world issues and solve complex problems that go beyond the boundaries of a single discipline. He said: “They not only pick up transferable skills such as critical thinking and communication, but also discover the value of integrating insights from different disciplines – skills that are critical in today’s workplace. “For instance, an engineering student learns to go beyond figuring how a product works to consider its implications and unintended consequences on society.” Students in a discussion and giving a presentation during a mandatory class as part of the Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core.  As I have always said, a good university experience cannot merely be defined by the academics. NTU students are encouraged to participate in various activities to challenge themselves and put their ideas to the test. For instance, students from various disciplines come together every year to design an energy-efficient car that they will race at the annual Shell Eco-Marathon. At the 2022 event held in Indonesia, NTU’s hydrogen fuel car Nanyang Venture 12 won two coveted awards. Students are encouraged to make the most of internships, which have been mandatory since August 2021. With NTU’s strong ties with industry, students also get the chance to work with heavyweights such as Alibaba, Rolls-Royce and Continental, and be at the forefront of innovation. For certain degree programmes, going overseas is par for the course. Second-year students at the Asian School of the Environment, for instance, head to Bali in Indonesia for a two-week field experience. Journalism students get to experience the challenges of operating in different countries, from Timor-Leste to Germany, through overseas journalism electives offered by the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.  Ms Isabel Kua, a 22-year-old final-year student, was among 14 students who went to Berlin, Germany, as part of the Going Overseas For Advanced Reporting module in 2022. During the two-week trip, she learnt how to be adaptable and dogged as a journalist working in a country with a different culture and language. She produced two stories at the end of the trip, including one on Sri Lankan Tamils who have been trying to preserve their heritage while fitting into German society since fleeing civil war. These experiences are invaluable. Students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a different culture, forge meaningful networks and widen their perspectives. All this prepares them for careers in a global workplace. NTU graduates continue to be a top choice for local and global employers, with healthy overall employment rates over the last five years. In 2021, more than nine in 10 NTU new graduates were employed within six months of completing their final examinations. More than eight in 10 were in full-time permanent employment. Let me highlight two students whose education both in the classroom and outside of it helped them land top jobs. One is Ms Nithya Krishnan, 25, who graduated last year from NTU’s flagship interdisciplinary undergraduate engineering programme called the Renaissance Engineering Programme. Nithya Krishnan, who graduated from NTU’s Renaissance Engineering Programme in 2022. During her time at NTU, she was exposed to different forms of engineering. She also went to Imperial College London as part of NTU’s exchange programme, and also did an internship with McLaren. These opportunities helped her to get a job in global investment bank and financial services company Credit Suisse as a technology analyst, where she utilises her software engineering skills to fix system bugs and work on or create new banking features. Another example of getting a great first job after completing his studies is Mr Ken Loo, 25, a business degree graduate. Ken Loo, who graduated with a business degree from NTU, was also active in sports. He went on five internships, including one with McKinsey & Company, where he landed a full-time job as a business analyst upon graduation. While in NTU, Mr Loo was also active in non-academic activities. He was the captain of the touch rugby team for his hall of residence and a member of the NTU rugby team, which he says helped him develop in other ways. Source: Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Publishers should also be renowned in their fields. Please read our Donation of Materials to Library Policy for additional acceptance criteria and for instructions on how to make the request. There are other places that you can consider donating your books to instead of an academic library. They are: Book exchange corners are currently found in nine public libraries, spread out around the different parts of Singapore.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Experiential and Collaborative Learning (ECL) For NTU to truly deliver a holistic university education that can develop attributes and competences required by our students to be successful in the future world, Experiential and Collaborative Learning (ECL) must be a key pillar in our education strategy. The ECL approach inspires students to develop an innate desire to explore and create, and an astute attitude towards risk taking, which they may not easily acquire through conventional didactic teaching and learning. Experiential learning is conceptualised as a learning cycle consisting of the following four stages: Collaborative learning, on the other hand, presents a situation in which two or more people learn or attempt to learn something together, and when effectively carried out, nurtures both individual accountability and positive interdependence. The ECL Office will support stakeholders in NTU in the following ways to allow ECL to be an integral part of NTU Education: Identify best practices in ECL through engagement with various Schools and student-facing departments Explore new pedagogical approaches and modes of assessment relevant to ECL Integrate successfully piloted ECL pedagogies into the core of the revamped Curriculum and Co-Curriculum Framework Develop a framework to capture and record student learning and skills developed through ECL Formulate a system of appraisal (teaching / service component) to encourage active contribution by faculty Students who have been positively engaged in ECL will be able to: Carry out critical reflection as a component of meaningful learning Meet demands for self-directed inquiry to address real-world problems Take on innovation with a more risk-resilient frame of mind Identify relevant collaborators and work effectively with them Develop emotional intelligence and ethical sensitivity Better embrace lifelong learning Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus Entrepreneurship Internship Minor in Design and Systems Thinking NTU Makers' labs/Making and Tinkering courses They are currently administered by Schools and Departments in NTU, and the ECL Office will help to align them to frameworks and systems to enhance pedagogical outcomes of these practices.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student A Story of Library Technology Through Time Throughout the years, NTU Library has evolved as an academic library alongside Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to meet the changing needs of its users. Take a nostalgic trip down memory lane and learn about the technological milestones that marked our journey, along with the machines and media that helped us to be at the forefront of technology for our information and knowledge services. Visit Level 2 of Lee Wee Nam Library to see and experience the machines and media of time past featured in the story below. Our first University Librarian Mr Lim Hong Too in an interview about NTU Library's early days. Those acquainted with our founding University Librarian Mr Lim Hong Too from our early days as Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) Library fondly remember his vision of a ‘high-tech’ library to anticipate and serve user needs effectively. Eschewing traditional notions of librarianship, Mr Lim envisioned an “automated” and “computer-assisted” Library that would efficiently support research and study activities at the university.   A 'Cat' Above the Rest - Machine-Readable Library Catalogues Without the conveniences of a digital library discovery tool (such as NTU Library's OneSearch ), libraries in the past used union card catalogues - printed catalogue cards with information such as author's names, book titles, subjects, and book locations that users had to sieve through manually. A microfiche sheet from NTU Library's machine-readable catalogue Under Mr Lim's vision of a computer-assisted library, however, NTU Library skipped cataloguing in print form altogether. In 1982, NTU Library joined the Malaysian Machine Readable Catalogue (MALMARC) project led by Universiti Sains Malaysia to produce its library catalogues on machine-readable microfiche sheets. NTU Library's early adoption of machine-readable microfiche catalogues would save the library days of work when the time came to digitise its records. Since NTU Library's entire catalogue was already in machine-readable format, uploading it into the new library system was a relatively simple affair that took only 15 hours, whereas many other libraries that started with a manual card catalogue would have taken a much longer time. This was an achievement that caught the attention of other participating libraries in the MALMARC project and the then-National Librarian of Malaysia. Display 2 - Exhibit 8, 9, 10: Microform NTU Library carried microform material in two formats - microfiche and microfilm. Microform is an umbrella term for material where visual content has been reproduced in a greatly scaled-down size. Exhibit 8: Exhibit 9: QST – American Radio Relay League microfiche journal (January 1941 – December 1941) Exhibit 10: The Business Times microfilm reel (1–15 May 1999) The concept of micro-photography was first introduced in 1839 by optician and inventor John Benjamin Dancer, and later developed commercially for use in banks during the 1920s. Microform would also be used at libraries as a distribution and archival format. A notable example was Harvard University Library’s Foreign Newspaper Project in the 1930s, which preserved old newspapers in microfilm format.   Microfiche Microfiche contains micro-images in a grid arrangement on 105 mm film stock, which is cut into smaller sheets that are viewable on a microfiche reader. Microfiche commonly comes in 4 x 6-inch sheets, each containing up to 98 micro-images. While microfiche readers are no longer available at NTU Library, you can watch this video (from 02:19 to 03:07) to find out how the machines were used to view library catalogues in microfiche form. Exhibit 8 is a microfiche sheet from NTU Library's catalogue, dated October 1994. With the launch of library discovery tool OneSearch in 2012, users can now easily search and access NTU Library's various resources with just one search box.   Microfilm Microfilm captures images in greatly reduced sizes on a film reel and is an incredibly compact data storage format. Microfilm reels can come in 16 mm or 35 mm widths. Exhibit 10 is The Business Times newspaper microfilm dated 1 to 15 May 1999. NTU Library keeps an archive of The Straits Times and Business Times in microfilm format. Users may borrow and view microfilm reels at the microfilm readers available at Business Library and Chinese Library . Watch the video below to find out how to view microfilm reels using microfilm readers at NTU Library. NTU Library constantly sought ways to simplify the manual processes undertaken by users to search, access, and borrow resources from the library.   Users searching NTU Library's Online Public Access Catalogue, which was available on any PC linked to the campus network.   Electronic Library Notices   Users queueing up to check out library materials. Long snaking queues at the Library’s Service Desks were once a common sight, especially near closing time when students would borrow Course Reserves material for the night.  To borrow library material, users had to write their details on borrowing cards and verify their identity with a student or staff ID card. This manual process was time-consuming for users. A user using one of NTU Library's first self-checkout kiosks. NTU Library introduced the 3M self-check system in 1994. Loaning library resources became much faster and simpler once NTU Library introduced self-checkout kiosks in 1994. Skipping the long queues at the Service Desk, students saved time by checking out library materials on their own with a simple two-step process: scanning the barcodes on their student card followed by the barcodes of the books. This improved user experience and work processes for staff. Technology was developing at a rapid pace during the 1990s and 2000s, with many new media and data-storage formats emerging one after the other.    A user borrowing media resources from the Audiovisual Department. These days, we take for granted that everything would be available to us in a click. In a time where many did not have ready access to technology, NTU Library set up a special Audiovisual Department to expand its non-print resource collection and bring the latest technological trends to its users. A user viewing a VHS tape using a VCR player at the Audiovisual Department. Set up from 1994-1998 at Library 2 (now the Business Library), the Audiovisual Department provided the latest media and media players for in-library use. Users could borrow, for example, a Video Home System (VHS) tape, and view it at one of the media-viewing stations installed with a videocassette recorder (VCR).   DISPLAY 1: AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS IN ANALOGUE FORMAT All the media presented at our display are analogue – do you know the difference between analogue and digital technologies?   Display 1 - Exhibit 1, 2, 3: Film Reels NTU Library kept film reels as archival material for films and motion pictures. Exhibit 1, 2, and 3 are 16 mm film reels. Exhibit 1: Film reel (16 mm) - Meetings, Bloody Meetings [motion picture]. 1976 Exhibit 2: Film reel (16 mm) -  Concrete Practice. Placing and Compacting [motion picture]. 1970 Exhibit 3: Film reel (16 mm) - Paris Subway [motion picture]. 19-- Exhibit 1 is a film reel of a video training course titled "Meetings, Bloody Meetings", which was first approved in 1983 for viewing in Singapore. Owing to its popularity as an educational resource in NTU's communications courses, "Meetings, Bloody Meetings" was also made available in videocassette format (see Exhibit 5a). Exhibit 2 is a 1970 film reel containing an educational video resource for engineering students titled "Concrete Practice: Placing and Compacting". Exhibit 3 is a 19-- film reel titled "Paris Subway", which shows the construction of two tunnels between the Regional Central Metro station and the Lion Station. The original film reel was a wheel-like frame that held about 300 m of 35 mm film, which yielded about 10 minutes of video. The clarity of the film footage depended on reel size. As film technology developed further, film stock would also come in other widths such as 16 mm and 8 mm. When recording, the lens of the camera shines light on the film, which causes it to darken – creating negatives, or images in inverted colours. The first moving image was produced in 1888 by a Frenchman named Louis LePrince, who shot a 2-second-long video of his family and friends titled the Roundhay Garden Scene . After 1912, longer movies started to achieve widespread popularity, and multiple-reel pictures, as they were called, would go on to become what we know today as feature films. Did you know: In the era of silent films, live bands and orchestras would sometimes accompany movies to help provide sound. A good movie transports you to a different world, but back in the day, movies captured in film reels had to be flown all over to cinemas for viewing. Display 1 - Exhibit 4, 5(a), 5(b): Videocassettes At NTU Library, video content such as training guides, documentaries, international movies, and more were frequently sought after by faculty and students to aid teaching and learning. Back then, these video resources were commonly available in videocassette formats such as U-matic and Video Home System (VHS). Exhibit 4: Exhibit 5a: Exhibit 5b: Meetings, Bloody Meetings [video-training guide]. 2000 Videocassettes were plastic cassettes that held videotape, a magnetic tape that recorded and played video and audio. With videocassettes, people could store hours of footage in a lightweight format, a far cry from the heavy film reels of the past. U-matic The U-matic, invented by Sony in 1969, was the first-ever videocassette and found great popularity at television stations. The U-matic had a large cassette size and contained 0.75 inch video tape. Though it had a relatively shorter run-time compared to later videocassettes, its study form made it durable. VHS Video Home System (VHS) was a video tape recording standard first released in 1976 by the Victory Company of Japan (JVC), which would eventually become the predominant videocassette format. VHS cassettes held about 430 m of 0.5 inch magnetic tape and could play up to 5 hours of footage. Various VHS sub-formats would also come along, with VHS-C introduced in 1982 and S-VHS in 1987. Did you know: VHS was one of several competing videocassette formats during the early 1980s. VHS would eventually triumph over its biggest competitor, Betamax, as VHS tapes were cheaper and offered longer run times. "Meetings, Bloody Meetings" is a video recording that has been available at NTU Library first as a film reel, and later as a videocassette – a testament to its popularity as an educational resource. It was used in the communications courses of NTU.  Display 1 - Exhibit 6: LaserDisc NTU Library maintained a LaserDisc (LD) collection of prominent classic films and educational videos. Exhibit 6: LaserDisc - "The Puzzle of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse" [videorecording]. 1982 Introduced in 1978, the LD was 12 inches in diameter - 2.5 times bigger than an average compact disc (CD). A competing audiovisual format to VHS, LD's invention heralded subsequent technologies like the CD, Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), and MiniDisc. A comparison of several disc storage formats. Image adapted from Cmglee, CC BY-SA 3.0 . LDs played about 30 minutes of video per side, and like tape cassettes, users had to manually flip the disc over halfway through playing it. Exhibit 6, a 1982 LD titled "The Puzzle of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse", was an important video resource for civil engineering courses that was first available only in LD form. In the 2000s, a faculty requested that the title be made accessible for multiple users at any one time, but this was not possible with the physical copy of the LD. Hence, the Library went the extra mile to obtain copyright clearance, digitise and upload the title to the video-on-demand server for wider access. Did you know: Though a LD looks like a giant CD, the former is analogue unlike the latter, which is digital. The LD struggled to achieve mainstream prominence as it was bulky, fragile, expensive, and could not record content, unlike formats like VHS and DVD. Display 1 - Exhibit 7: Tape Cassette In the past, language textbooks in NTU Library's collection often came with supplementary tape cassettes to support language learning at the university. Exhibit 7: Tape cassette - Le nouveau sans frontières 1 : méthode de français [sound recording]. 1995 Exhibit 7 is from a 1995 set of French-language tape cassettes titled "Le nouveau sans frontières 1 : méthode de français". First developed in the 1960s, tape cassettes, also known as cassette tapes, audiocassettes, and Compact Cassettes, allowed people to distribute sound recordings and music more conveniently and widely. About 0.15 inch wide, tape cassettes had two sides (A- and B-sides) that users had to manually flip between while playing. Each side typically contained up to 30 minutes of audio. Tape cassettes could either be sold with pre-recorded material or as a blank tape. In the 1990s, tape cassettes would eventually dwindle in popularity as CDs rose in use. Did you know: The audiocassette was originally created as a dictation tool rather than to record and play music. DISPLAY 2: DATA STORAGE MEDIA   Display 2 - Exhibit 11, 12: Floppy Disks A comparison of different data storage formats. Image adapted from Cmglee, CC BY-SA 3.0 . A floppy disk is a magnetic storage medium first introduced by IBM in 1971. The original floppy disk had a diameter of 8 inches, with a storage capacity of about 80 KB - a number that would seem insignificant today but was considered ground-breaking at the time. Exhibit 11: 5.25 inch floppy disk - Dissertation Abstracts on Disc [Installation Diskette, Search Software]. 1987 Exhibit 12: 3.5 inch floppy disk - Microsoft Word (2.0) for Windows: Basic Skills [Skill Builder Installation Diskette, Clipboard Diskette, Practice Exercise Diskette]. 1992 Throughout the years, the floppy disk would get smaller as its storage capacity increased. 5.25 inch floppy disk The 5.25 inch floppy, which was introduced in 1976 and used throughout the 1980s, stored about 100 KB of information. Exhibit 11 is a pair of 5.25 inch floppy disks from 1987 containing installation and search software for a database of dissertation abstracts. 3.5 inch floppy disk The 3.5 inch floppy, invented in 1984 and popular throughout the 1990s, had 1.44 MB of storage space. Exhibit 12 is a 1992 set of 3.5 inch floppy disks for "Microsoft Word (2.0) for Windows: Basic Skills", containing installation software, a clipboard disk, and practice exercises. Micro flash memory cards.  Did you know: Today, it is not surprising to find micro flash memory cards that can contain up to 1 TB of data. The first 5 MB hard disk unit in 1956 , however, weighed over 1,000 kg and had to be carried around with a forklift. Display 3 - Exhibit 13: Cassette Deck Cassette decks were available at the Audiovisual Department for users to listen to tape cassettes containing supplementary materials for language learning or audiobooks. Exhibit 13: Cassette deck - Philips FC567 Dual Logic Stereo Cassette Deck. 1987 The very first cassette deck was a battery-operated compact cassette recorder introduced in 1963 by Phillips. Audio was recorded onto tape cassettes (see Exhibit 7) with an electromagnet within the cassette deck. During playback, the magnetic surface of the cassette's tape would in turn be interpreted by a tape head in the deck and converted into sound. Tape cassettes would be the go-to medium for recording audio until the late 1990s, where it was overshadowed by newer digital formats like recordable audio CDs. Exhibit 13 is a 1987 Philips FC567 Dual Logic Stereo Cassette Deck, accompanied by a tape cassette from the 1995 set of French-language tape cassettes "Le nouveau sans frontières 1 : méthode de français". Did you know: Re-recording audio onto tape cassettes was not as clean-cut as clicking 'copy' and 'paste' on computers. Sound from previous tracks would sometimes remain as background noise and accumulate with each re-recording. It was better to use blank tapes or a tape head de-magnetiser to ensure clear recordings. Display 3 - Exhibit 14: Videocassette Recorder (VCR) NTU Library provided VCRs at the Audiovisual Department for users to watch videocassettes containing documentaries, international movies, and local television broadcast programmes. Exhibit 14: Videocassette recorder (VCR) - Sharp VC-AA350 Video Cassette Recorder. Early 2000s The videocassette recorder is a device that uses magnetic tape to record, store, and play video footage. It contains tape heads that read and inscribe video and audio tracks onto the magnetic tape of a videocassette. The very first magnetic tape video recorder by Ampex. Image from Karl Baron, CC BY 2.0 . In 1956, Ampex introduced the very first magnetic tape video recorder for use at television broadcasting studios. Videocassette recorders for home use would come along several years later in the 1960s and become a staple household device by the 1970s. Exhibit 14 is a Sharp VC-AA350 Video Cassette Recorder from the early 2000s accompanied by the VHS title "An Immigrant's Story with Sweat, Tears and Toil: The Samsui Women", a 1995 current affairs programme produced by the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) now known as Mediacorp. Did you know: VCRs allowed people to record content playing on television for re-watching, sparking debates over copyright infringement among companies such as Universal City Studios and The Walt Disney Company. Personal recordings of television programmes were eventually deemed 'fair use' under copyright law. Display 3 - Exhibit 15: Cathode-Ray Tube Television (CRT TV) Exhibit 15: Cathode-ray tube television (CRT TV) - Sony KV-T21MN11 Trinitron Color TV. 1995 CRT TVs, fondly known as 'box TVs', were often accompanied by videocassette recorders at NTU Library's Audiovisual Department for users to view video resources. CRT TVs are based on cathode-ray tube technology, first developed in 1897 by German physicist Ferdinand Braun. The cathode-ray tube is a vacuum where streams of electrons are guided by electricity to trace patterns on a fluorescent screen. The first working electronic television system was created in 1931 by Vladimir Zworykin, working off the combined efforts of himself and his competitor Philo Farnsworth. By 1936, 2,000 television sets would be in use around the world. Exhibit 15 is a 1995 Sony KV-T21MN11 Trinitron Color TV, accompanied by Exhibit 14: Videocassette Recorder, and a 1995 VHS titled "An Immigrant's Story with Sweat, Tears and Toil: The Samsui Women". Did you know: In Singapore, free-to-air channels went digital from December 2013, and analogue TV broadcast officially ceased on 2 January 2019. Analogue CRT TVs that could not receive digital signals required a special set-top box. Those switching from CRT to flatscreen TVs had to lookout for digital-ready labels that indicated that the TV could receive digital signals. Display 6 - Exhibit 18: Microfilm Carrier Exhibit 18: Microfilm carrier (from microfilm reader) - Canon Autocarrier 100R M38044 Microfilm Carrier Microfilm readers, which contain lenses to magnify microfilm material (see Exhibit 10) to readable proportions, were provided at NTU Library for users to view microfilm reels. Exhibit 18 is a microfilm carrier, a machine part that would have been attached to a microfilm reader. When preparing to view microfilm on the reader, a user would place the reel on the spindle of the carrier, before inserting the reel through the rollers and glass panel into the take-up reel. Did you know: NTU Library still has microfilm readers at Business Library and Chinese Library. These microfilm readers offer scanning and printing functions as well. Watch this video to learn about microfilm readers at our libraries. Display 7 - Exhibit 19: Slide Projector Exhibit 19: Slide projector - Telex Caramate 4484 Sound Slide Projector. 1980s Slide projectors were provided for use in the Audiovisual Department and could also be found in NTU's lecture theatres and tutorial rooms. An early predecessor to the PowerPoint slides of today, slide projectors gained prominence in the 1950s as a home entertainment device where people would gather to watch personal photographs magnified onto a screen. Slide projectors were also popular at educational institutions as a visual instructional tool. The unique design of the slide projector's carousel trays made slides easier to load into the projector, prevented them from spilling out, and could be detached from the machine for easy storage. Exhibit 19 is a Telex Caramate 4484 Sound Slide Projector from the 1980s, accompanied by slides from NTU Library's past. Though the machine is no longer functioning, you can still view the slides using the Kodak slide and film viewer at the Time and Machine display. Thanks to technology, the memories and nostalgia behind these images live on. Did you know:   The Media Resource Library At the Media Resource Library, users had access to various multimedia and video-on-demand resources.  Keeping up with further developments in technology, NTU Library eventually transformed the Audiovisual Department into the Media Resource Library.    Providing Computer Access for NTU Library Users A bank of 500 PCs were installed on Level 2 of Lee Wee Nam Library for library users. In 2000, NTU Library introduced a whopping 500 PCs into Lee Wee Nam Library for users – a shocking number even by today’s standards. In a time where owning a personal computer at home was not a norm, the mass provision of computers within NTU Library was a huge step forward in ensuring technological access for the NTU community. Video-on-demand NTU Library's strategy for acquiring information resources has always been 'digital-first' to provide multi-user access. When it came to NTU Library's video-on-demand (VOD) service, which first launched in 1998 as a pilot project, acquiring AV resources in digital format meant that they could be streamed directly without any manual conversion from analogue to digital. Where users once could only use media resources within the Library, they could now access these resources through the campus network. To improve user access to important media resources in older formats, NTU Library also obtained copyright clearance to digitise titles in formats like VHS and LaserDisc and upload them onto VOD. Not all audiovisual titles could be offered through VOD for reasons such as cost and copyright considerations. In such cases, users could make an online request to have these titles temporarily digitised and delivered 'on the fly' to their computers for one time use. This was done using technology that could convert analogue media formats to digital as and when requested. GEMS and iGEMS A user accessing the GEMS digital library portal at the Media Resource Library. GEMS was a digital library portal launched alongside the Media Resource Library in 1999. It provided a one-stop platform for all library e-services and e-resources, such as digitised past-year examination papers, student theses and works, and subscribed database content.  This was a significant step forward in delivering library services and resources beyond library walls to users, and GEMS was featured in the news as the first digital library portal of its kind in Southeast Asia. Professor Cham Tao Soon, NTU’s founding University President, at the launch of university portal iGEMS. iGEMS, launched in 2001, was an online university portal that provided staff and students with personalised access to university services and resources – including the library – anytime and anywhere. An expansion of its smaller-scale predecessor GEMS, the creation of iGEMS was a testament not just to NTU Library’s success in innovating digital library services, but also the close working relationship the Library has maintained with NTU’s Centre for IT Services (CITS) over the years. As user needs evolved alongside technology, NTU Library further innovated to enhance the access it provided users, anytime and anywhere.  Today, accessing information has never been easier for the users of NTU Library.  OneSearch: One Search Box to Access It All Presently, NTU Library users can search across NTU Library’s various resources with OneSearch, a library discovery tool first launched in 2012.  First launched in 2012, OneSearch is a powerful library discovery tool that searches across NTU Library’s various resources to instantly connect users to the information they need. With just one search box, users can easily look for and access books, audiovisual media, library-subscribed content, and NTU publications – among many other kinds of resources. OneSearch is also a personalised one-stop platform where users can not only manage their library account but also directly access library services such as requesting materials, managing library loans, and even tracking and saving past searches. One of our NTU Library staff hard at work behind the scenes. The work of a library staff in an academic library has undoubtedly evolved through the times, and one must be agile in learning new skills and adapting to the shifting technological landscape and changing user needs. As automation and new technologies reduced the number of labour-intensive tasks, our library staff have turned their attention to newer areas of library work and collaborations with other NTU stakeholders on university strategic plans. For example, recent years have seen our staff becoming actively involved in research data managements services and open science. In the area of instructional services, NTU Library has also prepared its librarians by training them in the university's Foundations of University Learning and Teaching (FULT) pedagogy model and sponsoring them to receive additional certification in team-based learning. Data and software tools have also become invaluable aspects of modern library work. Our NTU Librarians have been upskilling themselves to stay abreast of these technological trends with the use of data analytics tools such as Python, Qliksense, and Tableau and software tools such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate repetitive processes in the library. Today, much of a library staff's work is performed on a computer. But what did they use before the invention of computers, and what might their workspace have looked like in the past? Visit the special showcase of the Librarian's Desk (Display 5) at the Time and Machine display located on Level 2 of Lee Wee Nam Library to find out. Display 4 - Exhibit 16, 17: Typewriters Exhibit 16: Exhibit 17: Electronic typewriter - Canon MX260. 1980s Before computers, the typewriter was an important office machine for the daily tasks of NTU Library staff. The typewriter was invented in 1867 by American inventor Christopher Sholes and became a viable commercial product in 1874. Increasingly popular during the 20th century, typewriters hit peak usage in the mid-1970s before being eclipsed by computers from the 1980s onwards. Upon pressing the keys of a typewriter, steel types in the machine produce printed characters by striking paper through an ink ribbon. The paper in the typewriter will be moved along whenever a key is struck. Exhibit 16 is a 1978 Olympia SG3(N) manual typewriter, while Exhibit 17 is a 1980s Canon MX260 electronic typewriter. Did you know: Some long-serving NTU Library staff recall attending typewriting courses, taking turns to use the office typewriter, and that a typewriting test was sometimes part of the hiring process. The proficiency of a typist is measured as words per minute with high accuracy (or WPM). When a typist goes too fast, the arms of the typewriter can sometimes jam into a pile. The Time and Machine display is organised by NTU Library in celebration of NTU’s 30th Anniversary and Alumni Homecoming 2021.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student New interdisciplinary collaborative core courses mandatory in undergraduate programmes; Postgraduate Transferable Skills Series; NTU will introduce a new interdisciplinary collaborative core (ICC) requirement in the undergraduate curriculum from the AY2021 intake.   7 new core courses introduced in the ICC are curated to focus on either key transferable skills or global challenges. These courses are developed by faculty of diverse disciplinary backgrounds and integrated for issues to be understood from various perspectives. Scheduled over the first two years of study, there will be deliberate mixing of students from different disciplines and team-based projects or assignments in these ICC courses to immerse students early in interdisciplinarity learning. The ICC courses will adopt the flipped classroom and collaborative learning, where the main content of each course will be provided to students before classes for self-study, so that they can engage in interdisciplinary group-based learning activities in the classroom to reinforce the concepts. What are the 7 ICC Core Courses? Postgraduate Transferable Skills Series (TSS) NTU will roll out the Transferable Skills Series (TSS) to all postgraduate research students for their further professional development and personal growth in line with the future-ready graduates vision. This is in the form of workshops or webinars based on four identified themes of career preparation, communication, competencies and wellbeing. Graduate students are free to opt in for these weekly complimentary TSS offerings. The Graduate College has initiated the communication skills training programmes which include the compulsory co-curricula of three-minute thesis presentation and the compulsory communication courses implemented through NTU Language and Communication Centre and the National Institute of Education (NIE). Postgraduate Career Coaching In postgraduate career development, the Graduate College will organise strengths-based coaching for career success and graduate leadership programmes for postgraduate students. Graduate students can discover their strengths and cultivate self-leadership and be prepared for the workforce. In partnership with NTU Career Attachment Office, postgraduate students will be offered specially curated career preparation skillsets and job recommendations through data analytics. New Interdisciplinary Major Programmes NTU has a wide range of undergraduate degree programmes, with diverse and flexible options available to do a single major, double majors, double degrees, second major and minor. We also have well-established premier scholars programmes (Renaissance Engineering Programme, University Scholars Programme, CN Yang Scholar Programme, NTU-NIE Teaching Scholars Programme) which are interdisciplinary in nature. The range of undergraduate programmes will be further enriched with the introduction of the following new interdisciplinary major programmes in AY2021: Double Degree in Bachelor of Accountancy and Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Bachelor of Science programme in Economics and Data Science Double Major Bachelor of Arts programmes: Linguistics & Multilingual Studies and Philosophy Linguistics & Multilingual Studies and English History and Linguistics & Multilingual Studies Chinese and Linguistics & Multilingual Studies English and Philosophy Philosophy and History Philosophy and Chinese English and History Chinese and English History and Chinese Enhanced Interdisciplinary Research Undergraduate Education will be further interwoven with research to leverage upon the synergy between them, such as more student internship placements in university-based corporate laboratories, and undergraduate research projects such as Final Year Projects or Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus (URECA) in pan-university research labs, centres and institutes. These projects will be interdisciplinary in nature to reflect real-world problems that need to be solved, and students will work in interdisciplinary teams. For postgraduate education, the Interdisciplinary Graduate Programme (IGP) offers PhD students with opportunities to pursue multi- and inter- disciplinary PhD research programmes in line with NTU2025 strategic research directions. In keeping with global trends and needs, the university will be introducing new PhD programmes in Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence-X (AI-X) under IGP in AY2020 and AY2021 respectively. In addition, IGP will be partnering with Nanyang Institute of Science and Technology for Humanities (NISTH) in providing more educational programmes on the interface of STEM and non-STEM opportunities for our graduate students. Building on our success of joint / dual PhD programmes with overseas universities, NTU will initiate the development of joint supervision programmes with both local and overseas universities. The joint supervision programmes provide NTU faculty and graduate students with diversified research resources and enriched synergistic research outcomes. With the aim of integrating learning, research and innovation, NTU plans to intensify its efforts on developing joint PhDs with corporations and institutions – locally and overseas, such as the Alibaba-Interdisciplinary Graduate Programme.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student 1. Learn like a pro As a student of the digital age, you’d appreciate being able to learn at your own pace. Go online with your laptops and tablets – such as the school-issued iPads for medical students – and pore through lectures and course content anywhere and anytime you want. Then thrash out ideas in groups in flipped classrooms – a great way to make friends too. Some of your lessons might incorporate virtual and augmented reality technology in smart classrooms. If you live in a hall, you can sign up for the many Residential Education programmes at your doorstep, where you can pick up real-life skills like cooking, yoga and gardening. 2. Start to grow your industry network Here’s a cool prospect for you. You’ll be directly mentored by industry insiders through guest lectures and research projects. The likes of Dyson, Rolls-Royce and Alibaba have set up labs here and are eager to tap your creative mind. Here’s where you start building your career network too. NTU has over 200 industry collaborators, so you’ll be rubbing shoulders with accomplished C-suite executives in class and perhaps over lunch. Work-study programmes are also an option. Looking to join Google, Shopee or Facebook, anyone? 3. Dive into research and be on to the next big thing Do you dream of creating vaccines for infectious diseases or transforming the fabric of the materials world? You need to get a foot in the industry first – unless you’re in NTU. From your freshman year, there will be plenty of avenues for you to immerse yourself in research that leaves an impact around the world, including the URECA programme where you join faculty-led research teams and earn a stipend in the process. 4. Make smart moves at the world’s top young university Ranked the world’s best young university by Quacquarelli Symonds since 2014, NTU is the home of invention. It won’t take long to get a glimpse into the future, with the NTU Smart Campus acting as a testbed for futuristic urban tech like self-driving food delivery robots and autonomous electric buses. Here, innovation is everywhere – even in your halls. Makers’ labs, garages or design studios in your residential block give you the space and tools you need to turn concept to prototype. If you have a sound idea, you’ll even receive seed money to develop and test it out. 5. Go global Follow the footsteps of alumni who built careers around the world after a rewarding global student experience. Go overseas for an internship, an exchange programme, a community project or a field trip, or take an entrepreneurship course that puts you in a tech startup in an innovation hotspot in Asia, Europe or North America. Students on the Renaissance Engineering Programme, University Scholars Programme and CN Yang Scholars Programme get overseas exposure as a core part of their curriculum. And don’t hesitate to pad your CV by flying the NTU flag at international competitions. 6. Get your dream job and pay It pays to be an NTU grad. Your interdisciplinary education and cross-disciplinary qualifications give you an edge in exciting jobs, including those that don’t yet exist. With help in career planning from their freshmen year, more than nine in 10 new grads secure jobs within six months of graduating. The latest graduate employment survey also shows that new grads earned more than previous cohorts, despite the pandemic, with alumni from Business & Computing, Medicine, Computer Science, Engineering & Economics, and Accountancy & Business among the highest paid. 7. Experience one of the world’s most beautiful campuses NTU leads in both beauty and brains, having also made several lists of the world’s most photogenic universities. It’s hard to disagree. Find a sanctuary from stress as you take a waterfront stroll. From your hall room, look out to greenery or a graceful water feature and colourful wildlife.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student We found love For these alumni couples, love blossomed amidst the halls, canteens and other sites of their alma mater. As they embarked on the journey of a lifetime, they chose to immortalise their love stories by returning to NTU for their wedding photo shoots. Text: Sadia Roohi Lim Yi Xuan (SBS/2019) and Let Jian Jie (NBS/2019) Photo: bobbykiranyeo How did the both of you meet? Yi Xuan (wife): We met after the NTU Sports Camp which we both participated in during our freshmen year, while attempting to run for group leaders for the next Sports Camp. Interestingly, I did not notice him throughout the whole camp. Jian Jie (husband): When I met her during those post-camp events, I knew I had to seize the opportunity to speak with her.  How did your affection for each other grow? Jian Jie: Yi Xuan moved to the hall I stayed at, Hall 16, when she was in her second year, and that made it much easier for us to meet up. We would usually have our meals at Canteen 16 or McDonald’s at the North Spine. We are both foodies and even bigger fans of McDonald’s so we would have a meal there at least once a week. We had numerous conversations over these meals and that allowed us to get to know each other better. What motivated you to return to NTU for your pre-wedding photo shoot? Are there any locations with special meaning for the both of you? Jian Jie: It has to be McDonald’s at North Spine as well as the running track at the NTU Sports & Recreation Centre. As we were both athletes, we would spend time exercising and running together. Our lives have not changed much since we tied the knot in October 2022 – trying to exercise as much as we can despite our work schedules and grabbing occasional dinners at McDonald’s. Yi Xuan: I moved to Hall 16 to join Jian Jie after freshmen year and we both stayed there until graduation. Both of us also participated in quite a number of sports during the Inter-Hall Games in our second year. Needless to say, Hall 16 is a place filled with memories and we definitely had to relive those moments. More about the couple Yi Xuan graduated from the School of Biological Sciences (SBS) and initially saw herself working in a lab as a researcher post graduation. However, the internship opportunities and exposure NTU provided her with allowed her to explore and pursue other areas of interest. Her current strategic planning and customer insights role in a medical device company is more business-related and taps on her science background. Jian Jie graduated from Nanyang Business School with a double degree in Accountancy and Business (specialising in Actuarial Science) and now works as an actuary in a reinsurance company. I’ll catch you if you fall Calleigh Cheah Pei Ling (SBS/2017) and Hii Siew Rong (MSE/2018) Photo: Knotties Frame Pte Ltd How did the both of you meet? Calleigh (wife): We met when we were both NTU hall cheerleaders. He was the captain for the Hall 1 cheerleading squad while I was from Hall 7. We spent quite a lot of time training for a performance for a recruitment activity. Any memorable moments or experiences that brought you closer during that time? Calleigh: One of the funniest interactions that I had with him was that one time when we were moving items to another area. I was carrying a large bag but it wasn’t heavy. He saw and asked if I needed help. I was a little embarrassed to accept the help so I just said that I could manage. To my surprise, not only did he not help, but he also told me that he was only going to ask me once, and casually walked off. I was baffled at that moment. It has been seven years since that day and I still occasionally tease him about it. We had plenty of suppers after training, and late night chats with our friends, so that brought us closer too. What motivated you to return to NTU for your pre-wedding photo shoot? Are there any locations with special meaning for the both of you? Siew Rong (husband): Cheerleading was a huge part of our lives during our NTU days. We poured our blood, sweat and tears into the sport. After we graduated, both of us took up coaching for one season of the inter-hall cheerleading competition, and it was one of the most memorable projects that we did together. We also often studied together and met up between classes, so the foundation of our relationship was built in NTU. We wanted our pre-wedding photos to be focused on where it all started, hence the choice of NTU Halls 1 and 7. More about the couple While Calleigh’s career as a biological researcher is directly related to her studies, Siew Rong’s path has taken him from materials science engineering to retail operations. Calleigh is a research officer at National Environment Agency, and Siew Rong is the head of operations for a locally-owned optical chain store. Married in 2022, the couple are expecting their first child at the end of 2023. Going the distance for love Lim Deqiang (MAE/2010) and Junie Tay (SBS/2011) How did the both of you meet? Deqiang (husband): We met at a welcome tea session organised by the Cultural Activities Club held at the former Student Activities Centre located beside the Quad Café. I think that place has been revamped now. What was the defining moment for you as a couple? Deqiang: Junie spent two years in Beijing as part of her double degree in Biomedical Sciences and Chinese Medicine. Managing a long-distance relationship and having the chance to visit her in China definitely brought us closer as a couple. What motivated you to return to NTU for your pre-wedding photo shoot? Were there any locations with special meaning for the both of you? Junie (wife): It was a rather simple decision for us as that was the place we met and got together as a couple. Hence, NTU holds a special significance in our hearts. Other than the former Student Activities Centre where we met, other places and moments that we remember fondly are Canteens A and B, and the long walks from the North to the South Spine.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Newfound confidence: Shy undergrad blossoms through vibrant university life Ms Gwyneth Tan’s vibrant university life has helped her break out of her shell. PHOTO: SPH MEDIA From finding a network of support to overseas experiences, the NTU-USP scholar discovered exciting opportunities that helped her build confidence Bright lights illuminated the stage, casting expectant gazes on Ms Gwyneth Tan. She quietened her beating heart, stepped out from behind the curtains and started to speak. Never had Ms Tan, 21, imagined that she would one day stand in front of a crowd and perform in a play. A few years ago, she was someone who enjoyed quiet hobbies like playing the guitar and listening to Korean pop music. Today she has become a billed cast member in a student-produced family drama, playing two shows in the limelight.   In search of a more confident self While in junior college, her research for a General Paper assignment led her to find a new role model. “I saw videos of Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan giving his speeches in Parliament and at the United Nations,” she recounts. “He is so charismatic and well-versed. Because of him, I was inspired to study public policy and global affairs.” Ms Tan’s admiration for the minister stemmed in part from her own quiet nature: She had been a shy girl who longed for a more exciting life. As she considered her university options, Ms Tan watched a NTU-USP video livestream, where students were interviewed and shared their experiences about school, living in student halls and travelling overseas. “I was attracted to this vision of university life,” she says. “Initially, I was scared about making new friends in a new environment. However, NTU-USP has a community of scholars and events to facilitate interaction, so I was reassured that I could find my community.” To prepare NTU-USP scholars for university life, the programme offers core modules which impart skills on writing and reasoning, living well and ethics. Ms Tan recalls attending mindfulness lessons which helped her to reflect, live in the moment and manage her academic stress. NTU-USP also guarantees hall residence for students who wish to stay on campus, which allowed Ms Tan to form close friendships with fellow scholars. “We would go to class together, have supper, do group projects and enjoy school events like Chinese New Year and Halloween celebrations,” says the third-year student, who is pursuing a degree in economics, public policy and global affairs.   “Now I am much more confident in public speaking and talking to new people.” – Ms Gwyneth Tan, scholar in the NTU-University Scholars Programme   Ms Tan is also active in student life. As the director of Alumni, Career, and Student Outreach for the NTU-USP Club’s 9th Executive Committee, she and her team invited alumni to share their life and work with current students. “I had no previous experience for this position, but I decided to just try for it. I am very proud of what I have achieved with my team,” she shares. On impulse, she also joined the hall dance team in her second year. She performed for the Hall Olympiad Closing Ceremony, an annual performance held by students at NTU.   Unforgettable overseas experiences NTU-USP also offers a Travel Overseas Programme for Scholars (TOPS) which provides a guaranteed overseas learning opportunity for all scholars. In Ms Tan’s first year, her cohort travelled to Ipoh to learn about sustainability efforts. One memorable moment was when she and her group mates had to collect animal footprints as a visual aid for their group work on wildlife conservation. “Many animals just did not want to step on the paper,” she says with a laugh. The scholar enjoyed her TOPS experience so much that she joined the programme again in her second year as a student mentor and led juniors on a trip to Chiang Mai. Another overseas experience she cherished was her four-month exchange programme in 2023 at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. There, Ms Tan took courses in development, inequality and trade, foundations in global security, and South Asia: culture, politics and the economy. These classes broadened her scope of learning and exposed her to a more relaxed collegial experience, where professors often enjoy conversing with young people. Through her experiences, Ms Tan says she has grown to become more confident. She relishes the opportunities to try new activities, especially those outside her comfort zone. “I never thought I would go into acting, for one – it was so foreign to me. Many of those opportunities came up suddenly and I acted on impulse to try them. Pre-university Gwyneth would not have been able to do all these things – leading, acting, having fun with friends,” she says. “Now I am much more confident in public speaking and talking to new people.”   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/preparing-for-the-real-world-through-cross-disciplinary-learning-and-overseas-exposure'}, IndexData{title='Graduate | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Inaugurated on 1 July 1991, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) started out as a teaching university which has today transformed into a research-intensive global university. Its predecessor institution, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI), was set up in 1981 on the grounds of the former Nanyang University to educate practice-oriented engineers for the burgeoning Singapore economy. In 1991, NTI merged with the National Institute of Education to form Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The alumni rolls of the former Nanyang University were transferred to NTU in 1996. NTU became autonomous in 2006 and is today one of the two largest public universities in Singapore. Nanyang Technological Institute (1981-1991) Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on 1 August 1981 with a charter to train three-quarters of Singapore’s engineers. Within four years of operation, it was singled out as one of the best engineering institutions in the world by the Commonwealth Engineering Council. The Council reached this verdict after an extensive four-year study of the courses offered by engineering institutions worldwide. When NTI started in 1982, it had a total student population of 582 in three engineering disciplines – civil and structural, electrical and electronic, and mechanical and production engineering. By 1990, the institute’s undergraduate student population had grown to 6,832. The first two graduate students were admitted in 1986. Three engineering schools were added, an the School of Accountancy from the National University of Singapore was transferred to NTI in 1987. A school of applied science was also started. In 1990, the government announced that the Institute of Education would be merged with the College of Physical Education to form the National Institute of Education and that it would be part of NTU upon its establishment in 1991.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student   The purpose of a credit-bearing internship is to enable the application of knowledge and skills which students have learned in the university in an authentic work environment. This is such that you can gain relevant exposures and develop practical industry experiences and skills that will facilitate your career decision and future transition into your selected vocation. It aims for students to develop professional competencies that will enhance employability and lifelong learning capabilities to support career and life endeavours and your readiness for the future of work.  Internship is a learning process in which by exposing the students to real life working environments as part of an academic curriculum helps you to develop and enhance academic, personal and professional competencies. Due to the diversity of the training environments and backgrounds of organisation supervisors, a significant part of the internship programme is based on a self-directed learning approach by the students.  Organisations participating in our internship programmes are required to provide a structured internship programme with emphasis on applications, management and hands-on experience for the students to:  apply knowledge learned  acquire practical skills  strengthen work values  gain interpersonal skills​ Work-Study Degree Programmes in NTU aim to enhance students' employability and readiness for full-time employment by offering multiple on-the-job training experiences throughout their course of study. They do so by providing opportunities for students to alternate between terms of studies and internship work. Students benefit from greater exposure to the professional work environment, allowing them to learn on the job, deepen technical skills, develop soft skills and cultivate an understanding of real-world practices. This combination of classroom-based education and practical work experience also serves to strengthen the partnership between NTU and industry leaders to nurture and shape the next generation of professionals. Companies will be able to gain early access to talents in NTU and groom them over time through the various internships and projects. They benefit from such a talent pipeline through the steady supply and engagement of skills- and career-minded students.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student A passionate and highly-driven fresh graduate, Eugene recently obtained his Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences Degree at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Over the past 4 years of his course of study in NTU, he started developing a deep interest in the field of Data Analytics/Data Science and have continuously focused on building up his analytical knowledge, quantitative skills and communication toolsets required for this field of work. Despite being diagnosed with a severe visual impairment since birth, Eugene constantly maintains a positive outlook and pushes himself harder than most average individuals to overcome all obstacles and not let it hinder his passion to pursue his goals and aspirations. We caught up with him for a chat to know what really gets him going. What can you recall about your first year in NTU and how was the adaptation/transition for you? I recalled that my first year in NTU wasn’t exactly a very easy one due to the new environment, culture and lifestyle that I had to get used to and adapt. Being a year 1 freshman back then, I felt a lot of uncertainty and stress even before I started my very first semester as I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into and had no idea on what kind of experiences were going to come my way once school starts. In terms of adaptation and transition, I would say that my biggest challenge was adapting to the University culture. Having a visual disability since young has caused me to need a lot more time to complete most of my tasks compared to others. Given that I came from a Junior College background before entering NTU, the issue of me needing more time to get work done didn’t affect me as much as the JC curriculum provided me more than sufficient time (2 years) to get ready and prepare for the A Levels. However, this wasn’t the case for the uni curriculum. Being visually impaired, the degree of independence in moving around comfortably on my own ultimately boils down to the level of familiarity I have for a specific location. What were the difficulties you faced in your course? I needed more time to complete my work. This is a constant struggle that I faced throughout the years. I basically must allocate a lot more time to my schoolwork just to keep up with the rest and hence have less time for other aspects of my life. Another difficulty that I faced would be due to the nature of the course that I’m in. Math courses are known to be pretty visual intensive (e.g. such as having lots of mathematical formulas, graphs, diagrams, tables, symbols, numbers, output of coding, etc). Thus, other alternative study methods such as a screen reader software that helps me access the materials via audio output wouldn’t work for my math modules. I have to put severe strain on my eyes all the time to read and access the course materials with the limited vision that I’m left with. Why did you choose to go into math?   During your course of study, there were many people who have rendered help to you. Among those people who had helped you, who has impacted you most? On a more general scale, those that have impacted me the most would be my family members and close friends that I have known even before I entered NTU as they are the ones that are always supporting me and helping me since years ago. Then, it must be my school’s Student Care Manager (SPMS), Mika Yap. She has often gone beyond her standard scope of work responsibilities to assist me in various ways. Some examples would be offering to help me print my course materials in enlarge print to save me the trouble of printing them myself. Image: Eugene with his Student Care Manager (SPMS), Mika Yap Next would be my school’s Associate Chair/Senior Lecturer, Dr Ku Cheng Yeaw. I first knew Dr Ku in my first year of NTU through reading an introductory Calculus course under his teaching. Being my lecturer for that course back then, he offered to give me extra weekly 1 to 1 consultation sessions on top of the regular classes to ensure that I could cope and handle the course content of his module well. Image: Eugene with Associate Chair and Senior Lecturer, Dr Ku Cheng Yeaw Lastly, it would be Ms Chia Woon Yee from the Accessible Education Unit (AEU). She is the one who oversees liaising with my school in making the necessary special arrangements for my exams, settling the different logistic and administrative procedures whenever I need to purchase any Assistive Technology Devices or any other special services for school use, orientating me around unfamiliar places within the campus, and helping to settle any other arrangements in response to making things in general more accessible for me. She is a very reliable staff from school whom I can turn to for any assistance that is related to my disability or have any form of accessibility consideration involved.         Image: Eugene with Ms Chia Woon Yee from the Accessible Education Unit (AEU) What were your goals when you entered NTU? Did you manage to achieve them? In terms of academic grades, I targeted for at least a second upper honours and as of where I stand currently, I did achieve it. I also strived to be more independent in all aspects of my life which I think the NTU culture has forced me to achieve it to a certain extent. Any encouragement or things you wish to offer to current undergraduates? Firstly, all undergraduates should strive to enjoy their University experience to the fullest regardless of whatever aspects of University life they wish to focus on more. University experience is a rather unique one and I feel that they should try to make it as fruitful and meaningful for them as much as possible such that there are great memories that they can take away with them once they graduate. Given enough hard work and resilience put in, I feel that you can overcome all difficulties and obstacles. They should try to do their best in everything they do in life and maintain a growth mindset to consistently improve and make a better version of ourselves for the future. What will you remember the most about your time in NTU after graduating? I think I will definitely remember the content that I have learnt in my course, the skills that I have developed over the 4 years in NTU, the nice people I met that have impacted my life, and the physical environment and culture of my school in general.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/beating-the-odds-with-honours'}, IndexData{title='Young women engineers mentor others to help them succeed | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Show me more results Published on 18 Jun 2024 Young women engineers mentor others to help them succeed The International Women in Engineering Day on 23 June honours the outstanding achievements of women engineers. Two NTU engineering alumnae under 40 share their career-building journey and how they contribute to the community. By Nur Isyana Isaman and Christine Teh When she was just six years old, Rachel Marie (MAE/2017) would spend Saturdays at her father’s car workshop, watching the mechanics at work. From there, she soon developed an interest in fixing mechanical parts. After graduating from a local polytechnic at 22 years old, she went on to work for SIA Engineering Company, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce as an aviation engineer. But her desire to broaden her professional knowledge spurred her to enrol in NTU’s mechanical engineering degree part-time course in her mid-20s.  For six years she juggled night classes, overnight job shifts and overseas work assignments to complete the course and graduated with a second-class honours degree in 2017. Rachel during her NTU Convocation in 2017.  Today, the 39-year-old works at Boeing as a Customer Instructional Systems Designer with a good understanding of the front-end and back-end aviation operations. She develops the modules, curriculum, and methodology with the Boeing learning and design team to train airline staff who operate Boeing planes. She goes on-site with airline staff to understand their pain points and help resolve technical issues. In the past, Rachel Marie provided operational support as a Rolls-Royce Field Service Representative. “As a female engineer in a male-dominated field, our strong suit is the willingness to improve ourselves and higher emotional intelligence. Women tend to be emotional, so use it to our advantage: trust your gut, command with respect, and rise above difficulties,” she shares. The alumna continues to take short courses for self-development and has recently signed up for the “FlexiMasters in Professional Development & Training” course at NTU.  Rachel said: “It is not just about getting certifications for my portfolio but being able to use them for the community by improving at my job. That is one thing that I will always encourage the younger generation.” She is also a key member of Boeing Women Inspiring Leadership and the Women in Aviation Singapore Chapter, where she is an industry mentor to students and gives regular career guidance talks in schools. Opening doors for others Jade Wee sees her analyst role as a blend of technicality and creativity. Another alumna who is passionate about learning and development and mentoring is Jade Wee (EEE/2016), Analytical Lead for the APAC Strategy & Operations team at Google. She has worked in the tech sector since graduating from NTU with a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Engineering and Media in 2016. At work, she drives corporate strategy and builds scalable tooling solutions to optimise operational efficiency and generate valuable business insights. Her leadership in developing an automated centralised solution has saved over 100 employee hours, showcasing her ability to design, build, and implement solutions that deliver tangible business results. Google recognised her achievement with multiple internal awards. Jade actively participates in hackathons beyond her core role, applying her creativity to address real-world challenges. In 2022, her team won an internal Google hackathon, where she conceptualised and built a winning software tool to solve the hackathon problem.  She is no stranger to hackathons. She embarked on her tech journey by winning a Samsung tech hackathon during her final year at NTU, collaborating with three female friends. "Despite lacking a computer science background, we were driven by our passion for the social issue we aimed to address," she recalls. "The win landed us internships with Samsung and kickstarted our careers." Despite a demanding career, the 30-year-old serves as an alumni volunteer on the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Alumni Advisory Committee. In March, Jade led the first week-long Google hackathon for NTU undergraduates. The event offered immersive learning experiences, including on-site classes by Google volunteers on topics like machine learning, generative AI, and statistics, and dedicated mentoring sessions with Googlers to help students refine their hackathon pitches. Another initiative she rolled out was a career talk where students were exposed to a day in the life of different Google engineers, from software to customer and user experience.  Jade said: “NTU has been instrumental in my career journey. An NTU email led me to a hackathon, an internship opportunity, and then a graduate programme, and eventually I started my first job at Grab doing marketing analytics. I have learned that you are never 100% ready for the next step, but NTU instilled in me the confidence to collaborate, face challenges, and deliver high quality work.” Jade Wee (second from right) and her friends won first prize for Samsung’s hackathon in 2015.  Jade (wearing red, second row, second from right) worked with her Google colleagues to host a hackathon for NTU undergraduates in 2024. The future of engineering Rachel firmly believes in encouraging more women to join the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields to provide diverse views. She takes on mentoring duties in various associations to coach science stream students. She said, “I wish I had a mentor when I started, but I did not, so I became a mentor to ensure that the younger generation get the help they need to navigate through their career.” Earlier this year, Rachel spoke at a glider building workshop for secondary school girls organised by Women in Aviation Singapore Chapter and NTU’s student-led School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Club. After the event, she connected with two MAE undergraduates who later sought her guidance for their university project. Rachel Marie (first from left) with participants during a glider building workshop at NTU.  Jade agrees that alumni mentors are important to students. “As an alumna, I know how overwhelming it can be to navigate career choices right after graduation. That's why I believe alumni mentors are so important. We can share our experiences, showcase the diverse opportunities available, and empower our juniors to create their own fulfilling careers,” she said.  She is excited about the future of engineering and is constantly learning to sharpen her skills. “The advancements in machine learning, particularly with generative AI, hold immense potential to revolutionise decision-making and problem-solving and will impact various industries. Personally, I am expanding my knowledge in UX engineering through the company’s learning programme. To be a good engineer, I say, embrace curiosity and view challenges as stepping stones to growth.” Happy smiles from Jade and her family to celebrate her graduation.  Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/young-women-engineers-mentor-others-to-help-them-succeed'}, IndexData{title='Networks & Alliances | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Text: Dr Daphne Ng Sonia Rao (WKWSCI/2015) is global manager, technical partner management (signals and measurement) at Meta, the company behind social networking site Facebook. A rising talent in the tech industry, she won the Emerging Star Award from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in 2023. Feon Ang (NBS/1994) is managing director, APAC, at business and employmentfocused social media platform LinkedIn. A veteran business executive with more than 20 years of experience in driving business growth and organisational transformation, Feon leads LinkedIn's business in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on the company’s vision of creating economic opportunities for every member of the global workforce. Suman Mishra (SCSE/2001) is managing director and CEO of Mahindra Last Mile Mobility Limited, India’s leading electric three-wheeler manufacturer. Suman’s achievements in developing and implementing strategic initiatives for organisations have been recognised by several awards, including the Automotive D.R.I.V.E Honours 2023 Visionary Leader of the World award by Reuters Events. She is also a recipient of the Nanyang Alumni Achievement Award 2023. A career often resembles a winding path, rather than a linear one. It also takes a lot of discipline to be exceptional at what you do. Sonia Rao juggled her master’s studies at NTU with her job as an operations coordinator and office manager at transportation company Uber. Despite her busy schedule, she did well and was awarded the Wee Kim Wee Legacy Fund Graduate Scholarship Award for her exceptional performance and leadership. Later, as a systems engineer, Sonia became interested in the work that the project managers sitting in the cubicles diagonally from her was doing. Like them, she wanted to travel the world to meet clients, instead of spending most of her days in front of a computer screen. Photo: Sonia Rao “I really wanted to work at the intersection of technology and business. One day, I walked into my manager’s office to request for a change. He was concerned that I might not be able to carry the heavy charging stations for the company’s electric vehicle platform,” recalls Sonia. Nevertheless, Sonia eventually transited from engineering to project management. Today, she leads and manages a team focused on technical partnerships for businesses at Meta. “Don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself,” she adds.

Photo: Sonia Rao For Feon Ang, joining a burgeoning LinkedIn was "the best career decision” she made. “Initially, I was apprehensive about joining a ‘young’ tech company like LinkedIn because it seemed like a risky career move. However, after reading the company’s co-founder Reid Hoffman’s book ‘The Start-up of You’ where he introduced the term ‘permanent beta’ – the idea that we are all works in progress and that we should treat every failure as immediate feedback on what's working and what's not – my perspective changed from one of fear to excitement for the opportunity to be challenged and grow,” she says. Photo: Feon Ang Both Sonia and Feon believe in treating difficult situations at work as opportunities for growth. “Given the fast pace of business, I have to make decisions quickly, sometimes in situations that are ambiguous and complex. I believe that the confidence to make a call despite uncertainty comes with expertise and experience as well as a strong alignment to a company vision,” says Feon. “Stay calm and respond to situations, instead of reacting to them. Pick your battles wisely but don’t shy away from conflict. In fact, managing conflict is an opportunity for personal and professional growth,” says Sonia. Lastly, having passion and purpose in what you do goes a long way to weathering the highs and lows of professional life. “One of the primary motivators in my life has been a genuine passion for what I do. When you love what you do, it doesn't feel like work,” says Suman Mishra. Photo: Suman Mishra Unforgettable university days Being exposed to different viewpoints fosters creativity and innovation. Sonia, Feon and Suman unanimously agree that the diverse learning environment that they encountered during their days at NTU has contributed to their success. It was at NTU that the female tech leaders picked up valuable skills for excelling in complex and challenging situations at work. For one, studying at NTU was Suman’s first time overseas, and she credits NTU's educational environment for a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving and effective teamwork. Beyond the lectures, they made lifelong friendships as interacting with students from different backgrounds also exposed them to different perspectives.

One of my fondest memories was playing basketball – I even took it more seriously than my lectures. I also took part in so many hall activities. Many of my peers have also remained good friends to this day,” says Feon. Feon playing her favourite sport, basketball, when she was an NTU undergraduate. Photo: Feon Ang “The best thing about being an NTU alumnus is my ‘NTU Alumni Group’. The support from this group of lifelong friends, who are now doing amazing things all over the world, has been incredible,” Suman agrees. There is no doubt that Feon and Sonia feel a sense of belonging to NTU. Feon finds time from her schedule to serve on Nanyang Business School’s Alumni Advisory Board to create learning and networking opportunities for students. “It’s been an honour to give back to the institution and the broader community, to help them succeed in their careers, even as I grow in mine,” says Feon. On the other hand, Sonia reads HEY!, NTU’s student magazine, and U, NTU’s alumni magazine, to stay connected to the NTU community. She also tries to visit the campus from time to time and take part in events. Guides for others Outside of work, Sonia is a career coach who shares her insights as a leader in the tech industry. “I feel most fulfilled when I am a part of the success of others. As a manager and career coach, I am focused on helping people grow and build their skillsets,” she says. She also co-leads Women@Meta, which champions gender equality, creates opportunities for women to thrive, and promotes diversity and inclusion in the workplace. At LinkedIn, Feon started a programme called EmpowerIn to help mid-career women grow as leaders through a supportive community of peers, with access to leadership resources and mentors. She is also a mentor with the Young Women’s Leadership Connection, where she works with young female professionals to nurture the next generation of women leaders in Singapore. “One of the most common barriers that women still face in the workplace today is having to choose between career and family. Women need and should recognise that their presence and contributions hold significance,” Feon says. “It’s my personal goal to empower women in the workplace and help drive the professional growth of my female colleagues.”   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/tech-ing-the-lead'}, IndexData{title='About Us | Delta-NTU Corporate Laboratory | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Appreciating alumni’s acts of service Alumni volunteers, leaders, and supporters gathered at NTU’s first Alumni Volunteers Appreciation Night in February. Among them was Hidhir Razak, who has been giving back to the university for 10 years. By Nur Isyana Isaman Hidhir (wearing green, first from left) and fellow SoH volunteers distributed welfare packs to Boon Lay residents as part of a community event. (Photo credit: SoHAA) It has been a decade since Hidhir Razak (SOH/2014) completed his Bachelor of Arts in English at NTU, but to him, it feels like he has never really left his alma mater. Upon graduating in 2014, Hidhir joined the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (now known as the School of Humanities or SoH) Alumni Association as its honorary general secretary. “I wanted to maintain a deep, tangible connection to the school that I had made so many fond memories in,” said Hidhir, who also received a Master of Arts in English and Creative Writing from NTU in 2018. “A senior recommended the alumni association to me, and with support from my peers, I decided to run for a position within the association.” Over the years, Hidhir has served in different roles at the alumni association and witnessed it becoming the School of Humanities Alumni Association (SoHAA) in 2018. He was voted to become the association’s president in August 2022. The 34-year-old juggles his voluntary role with his full-time job as a corporate relations manager at a learning and development consulting firm. “In 2022, we as a country were still reeling from a pandemic, so in our first committee meeting, we decided that we not only needed alumni and the school to be more connected to each other, we also needed our alumni and school to be of greater service to the communities around us,” said Hidhir. Their vision came to life through the Festive Cheers @ Boon Lay in January 2023, when volunteers comprising SoH alumni, students, and staff helped to pack and distribute 700 welfare packages to families, alongside partners from the South West Community Development Council and the NTU Office of Alumni Engagement. A similar event was repeated just this month. With additional support from a local company, Ecoplus International, the team distributed 800 welfare packs to Boon Lay residents. The community event was organised in addition to SoHAA’s regular alumni bridging activities, such as workshops, movie screenings, and gatherings. In February, more than 160 guests were invited to the Alumni Volunteers Appreciation Night to thank Hidhir and other alumni who have contributed to NTU as volunteers, leaders, and supporters. NTU alumni volunteers, leaders, and supporters joined Prof Boh to raise their glasses and toast to success.  In her welcome address, Prof Boh Wai Fong (NBS/1997), Vice President (Lifelong Learning & Alumni Engagement) and a Nanyang Business School alumna, thanked fellow alumni for sharing their time, talent, and resources to give back to the university. Prof Boh said, “Year after year, more alumni volunteer for NTU in various capacities. In 2023, alumni set a record – about 2,600 alumni paid it forward and gave their time and effort as project committee members, activity participants, mentors or speakers.”  During the event, the collegial alumni community networked and celebrated the start of a new year over dinner and yusheng, as well as lion dance and student performances.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Top speed for Best Foot Forward 2024 Over 1,100 participants clocked over 73,000km during the third edition of NTU’s fundraising challenge Best Foot Forward (BFF) and raised over S$180,000 for university funds. By Nur Isyana Isaman With a total distance of over 2,700km, Raymond Howe clinched first place in the new virtual cycle category introduced for BFF 2024.  The NTU staff, who is a first-time BFF participant, is also on the leaderboards for top runners and top individual fundraisers. He ran almost 1,540km and raised over S$1,500. Raymond Howe clocking his cycling distance for BFF 2024.  “I did not participate in previous BFFs as I did not want to disrupt the training programme for my Ironman triathlon races. But after witnessing my colleagues’ efforts and the motivations behind their own journeys, I was inspired. Every day for two months during BFF, I ran at 3am and cycled during lunch time, then do my Ironman training in the early evening before clocking BFF distances from 10pm onwards,” said the 61-year-old. Raymond was not always an exercise enthusiast. In fact, he used to be a heavy smoker and drinker. He was also overweight at almost 100kg. His turning point was a cancer relapse in 2000, which spurred him to embrace fitness. The two-time cancer survivor said, “Participating in BFF this year has served as extra training for my 28th Ironman race in Cebu later this month. What inspired me to do all this is because I had cancer. I'm in remission now and exercise has kept me healthy. I hope to inspire people to keep on exercising and never take good health for granted.” Making great strides Catch our zealous participants in action, raising funds for NTU while keeping fit. BFF 2024 kicked off with the physical flag-off X Campus Run on 2 February and ended on 5 April, garnering participation from over 1,100 NTU students, alumni, faculty, staff, and supporters.  Together, the participants recorded a total distance of over 73,000km by running, walking, or cycling, and raised more than S$180,000 for the NTU Bursary Fund and School Advancement Funds in support of student and school development. These records surpassed 2023's performance.  Among the school teams, Nanyang Business School (NBS) emerged top after raising over S$37,000. Meanwhile, National Institute of Education (NIE) raised over S$17,000 and the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) raised over S$11,000.  Stay tuned for the next edition of Best Foot Forward on NTU Giving website .   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/top-speed-for-best-foot-forward-2024'}, IndexData{title='Joint NTU-TUM Master of Science in Green Electronics | School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student A Plankton World Map: NTU helps shed light on unseen marine life worldwide Photo Illustration: Pexels Microscopic life dominates ocean waters, with more than 98 per cent of marine biomass comprising plankton and other microbial organisms invisible to the naked eye. Scientists from Singapore’s NTU, the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and Uppsala University in Sweden now hope to bring this unseen life to light. The team came together to build, curate and publish a global database of thousands of samples of these organisms from across the world. Called metaPR2, the database was published in the Molecular Ecology Resources journal in 2022. Asst Prof Adriana Lopes dos Santos from NTU Asian School of the Environment , co-lead of the project, said: “Many people know protists or microbial eukaryotes by common names.” In the Web application that the team created, plankton communities are identified by colourful circles that speckle the world map like stickers.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Completing the Minor in Modern Languages demonstrates an appreciation of foreign cultures and an interest in the world beyond. A minor in a foreign language (French, German, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Spanish, Russian, Chinese or Thai) will enable students to acquire higher-level language skills and to perceive areas of their specialisation in a new light. These qualities provide extra dimensions for career opportunities in the private industry, the non-profit and government sectors, as well as for graduate school or academic careers. This minor also adds an important credential to CVs and can greatly improve employment prospects. Benefits In our globalised world, having a good proficiency in one or more foreign languages is an advantage that more and more employers are recognising. Being multilingual is a great benefit to the nations' economic competitiveness, political success, and security.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student   The mission of the NTU URECA programme is to nurture our outstanding undergraduates into the next generation of researchers.  The URECA opportunity is offered to outstanding students in years 2 or 3 of study and we aim to empower students, helping them to recognise their potential through research projects that make real world change. For many students URECA provides an entry path to a research career and we aim to ignite a passion for research by facilitating research projects, hosted in NTU’s world-class research ecosystem and conducted under the excellent mentorship of the NTU faculty and research staff. At URECA we value innovation, ambition, collaboration and inclusiveness and since its inception in 2004, more than 10000 students have discovered and developed their passion for research on the URECA journey. I note that around one-third of our students pursue post-graduate studies in NTU and elsewhere, demonstrating that URECA is meeting its key aim of recruiting, training and equipping the next generation of research talent. Throughout the year, URECA students get the opportunity to take part in several key events. Firstly, the annual poster exhibition provides students with a stage to exhibit and present their research to the rest of NTU.  Then, our students in Singapore are encouraged to participate in the International Conference of Undergraduate Research (ICUR), and present their research alongside students from many reputable universities across the USA, Canada, UK, Japan and Australia. Many will also be asked to submit their research to the Global Undergraduate Award (UA) a world leading programme which allows students to share their work with a global audience and connects students across cultures and disciplines. Many of our students have won prestigious awards here in the past, and we hope to continue this tradition. Publishing and presenting is also key to academic research and it is great to see that every year URECA students publish in journals of international repute and present their research at top international conferences in their chosen field. Integral to the success of URECA is the collaborations with Corporate Laboratories and partners and with Research Institutes and Centres at NTU. The URECA collaboration network allows undergraduates to apply their theoretical knowledge to actual research projects and a chance to work in challenging research environments with industrial relevance. We are always heartened by our undergraduates' enthusiastic response to the URECA program. The enthusiasm is no doubt a tribute to all the faculty who have supervised and mentored URECA students in the past. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the URECA students and faculty for the excellent work they have done. The URECA team thank all our partners and contributors for their support and we look forward to enriching the URECA program further. I warmly welcome you to the URECA community and wish you an enriching research journey ahead. Professor Adam D.

Entrepreneurship and leadership foundational skills will be introduced on top of career skills in the modules.  Launched in August 2021, the new Interdisciplinary Core Curriculum (ICC) for all freshmen comprises four transferable skills essential for thriving in the new economy and a deep dive into three global challenges -- Sustainability, Impact of Science & Technology on Humanity, and Mental Health & Well-being. MLCPS is part of the ICC's aim to equip every NTU student with the four essential skills, especially in foundational Careers, Entrepreneurship & Leadership skills, to thrive in an IR4.0 era.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Eye on research A self-professed “avid aquarist and gardener”, NTU Biological Sciences student Ryan Soh said it all began when he was a child. His parents wouldn’t let him have cats or dogs as pets. They suggested he start with fish instead and he’s stuck with the hobby since. Over the years, he’s kept both fish and invertebrates such as crayfish and snails, and he tries to mimic their natural environment in the tanks to improve their quality of life. It is this love for plants and animals that drew Ryan to microbiology. “After all, the world of bacteria, fungi and viruses is a microcosm of the world of animals and plants. There are many parallels that can be drawn between the world under a microscope and the world we can see with our naked eyes,” he says. The aspiring microbiologist is part of the NTU CN Yang Scholars Programme and is working on his final-year research project at NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine investigating the relationship between two bacteria commonly found together in infections that may help in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/eye-on-research'}, IndexData{title='Spark your passion for research | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Spark your passion for research with over 200 industry collaborators Being immersed in research can spark a lifelong passion as in the case of Biological Sciences student Steph Song, who discovered her affinity for healthcare research, specifically in reproductive biology, at NTU.“I was born a premature baby and research into this area fascinates me as it helps me understand my own life story. I’ve worked on three research projects so far, on topics revolving around female physiology, hormones, cancer and urinary tract microbiology,” she says. The CN Yang scholar, who wants to do her final-year project remotely with Harvard Medical School, clearly enjoys jumping headlong into research. “Many times, a surprising result can be achieved with the smallest and – what we think is – the most insignificant thing. I take joy in discovering the unknown, and it’s rewarding to see your effort become part of a discovery that could potentially change the world,” she says. Under the new Global Alliance of Industries @ NTU, undergrads will have even more opportunities to be part of research done with more than 200 industry collaborators that include those with laboratories at NTU, such as Rolls-Royce, Delta Electronics, Saab and Alibaba Group.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/spark-your-passion-for-research'}, IndexData{title='NBS Alumni Office | Nanyang Business School | NTU Singapore | Nanyang Business School | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

OpenCerts is the umbrella trademark of the platform backed by the Ethereum blockchain technology to generate cryptographic protections for educational credentials. It provides a common standard for the issuance of digital certificates by recognised institutions on the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) registry, as well as the verification of the authenticity of the certificates. NTU is one of the recognised issuing institutions on the registry. Is my personal data safe on the blockchain? Academic records and personal data reflected in the digital certificate and transcript are not published on the blockchain. A hash is generated from the digital certificate and transcript and is used to verify the authenticity of the digital document. The process of computing the hash from the digital certificate and transcript is not reversible. Since the hash is the only information published into the blockchain, no personal information can be obtained from the content on the blockchain. Is the OpenCerts document an official document? Yes, you will be able to view the official degree certificate and transcript issued by the University when you drop the OpenCerts document in the verification section of the OpenCerts webpage. With OpenCerts, you will no longer need to request for certified hardcopies of your degree certificate or additional copies of your transcript. Will the digital certificate and transcript look identical to the physical copy of my degree certificate and official transcript? The appearance of the digital certificate and transcript may not fully replicate the physical copy of your degree certificate and official transcript. The digital document is verified to be authentic if it can be viewed successfully without any error message on the OpenCerts platform. Can I print my OpenCerts certificate and transcript? Printing the OpenCerts certificate and transcript discards all the advanced cryptographic protections that are built into the OpenCerts, hence printing is not recommended. Can I save and view the OpenCerts document in PDF format? The information in the OpenCerts document will only be readable on the OpenCerts platform. Can my OpenCerts document be renamed? You may rename your OpenCerts document. However, the .opencert extension needs to be retained and the content within the document should not be modified as that would render the document invalid. Where can I retrieve a copy of my OpenCerts document if I have misplaced it? The OpenCerts document is attached in the email sent from ntudigitalcert@ntu.edu.sg to your NTU email account. A copy of your OpenCerts document is also available in the Skills Passport in your individual MySkillsFuture account. Who can I contact if I am not able to log in to my SkillsFuture account? If you encounter any issues logging in to your MySkillsFuture account, please seek assistance via the Submit Feedback page in the SkillsFuture webpage. Can I be issued separate documents for my digital certificate and digital transcript? The OpenCerts digital certificate and transcript are issued as one document. You will separately receive an eTranscript which is digitally signed and certified by NTU and considered official and valid only in its certified PDF electronic form.  Can NTU help to send the OpenCerts document to the institution that I am applying to as this is a requirement from them? You may send the OpenCerts document to the institution directly and refer them to the steps in the section 'For Third Parties'. More FAQs on OpenCerts can be found here .

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student View the world through a historical lens As a student of NTU’s History programme, Ping Siang has learnt the significance of different societal norms and cultural practices, their impact on policy decisions and the ever changing global dynamics. The History programme in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) touches on various disciplines: Cold War politics, environmental history, or even plastic surgery's place in Korean history. Perhaps in this regard, one might think it almost impossible to coalesce these varied topics into a singular point of impact. Yet, that is exactly what the programme has done for me over the past three years. To critically think, dwell, and contemplate the "stories" of the world we've been told. In doing so, to question and revisit how we ourselves conceptualise the world - that is what every History module has done for students. A good teacher of mine in NTU History once said the following, "Every good scholarship in History draws a link between the past and present and uses this link to point out something about modern society". More than just reading and questioning stories, I find that my greatest takeaway from the course is learning how to illuminate the truth behind present societal mechanisms through the investigation of the past. In that sense, the past is brought to, and brings life to the "present" we are currently living in. I mean this in more than an academic sense of improvement, this takeaway is also one that has left an indelible mark on my personal life. For example, the recent COVID-19 pandemic that we've all been victims of, I now question how I came to have such a preference for biomedical vaccines over medicines such as TCM. Is it truly because they are more "effective"? Or is it simply because of historical factors and events that have subtly sculpted my own view of the world? There are many more instances of such moments in the everyday life where I question my own thoughts and how they come to be. Outside of being a student, I am also a national speed skater and naval officer with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). Two wildly different scopes that you might think have no relevance whatsoever to my pursuit of History. This is not the case at all. Beyond generic traits such as grit or determination, to which my professors have done a wonderful job of inculcating within students, the course has also taught me to how to formulate sound arguments and decisions. For example, I naturally seek out and understand the historical factors that underpin existing policy decisions. Even the act of serving the military and nation, I now embrace and internalise better as I know the history that comes with it. In that sense, what NTU History also does is to teach students historical empathy, understanding and emoting history of those before within our own lives, in order to better live our present day out. All in all, I've enjoyed my time in NTU History. More than just academically, the programme has provided my life with much more nuance and meaning. For prospective students, I highly recommend participating in the course or related modules over your coming years in NTU. I promise that it will be a fruitful experience that will redefine how you view and think of the world.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/view-the-world-through-a-historical-lens'}, IndexData{title='Joint-Graduate Programmes | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Ms Priyadharshini Chockalingam, 24, is on a mission to serve. “I was drawn to psychology because I am very fascinated by how complex people are: Why do they act the way they do? What are they thinking when they behave in a certain way? These questions intrigued me,” says Ms Priyadharshini. She is now a third-year student specialising in psychology with a second major in biological sciences. Currently enrolled in the NTU-University Scholars Programme (NTU-USP), Ms Priyadharshini had the opportunity to be involved in community service which greatly enriched her overall academic experience. Through its multidisciplinary programme, NTU-USP scholars are exposed to diverse learning opportunities that complement their studies, all while sharpening their critical thinking and leadership skills. Her first foray into community service was an internship with HealthServe, a non-profit group that provides medical care to migrant workers. “My time with HealthServe showed me how the healthcare we take for granted is not accessible to all. I want to provide healthcare to those who really need it,” she says. She now volunteers with Trampolene, a non-profit organisation that assists people with special needs. “These experiences have taught me that with education, I can help so many more people and do so much more for the world.” Source: The Straits Times | Scholars' Choice © SPH Media Limited.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student The Centre for Research and Development in Learning (CRADLE) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) supports multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research across NTU devoted to transforming learning in higher education. Leveraging on knowledge and methods from education, psychology, neuroscience, and technology design, CRADLE aims to develop and test theories to explain learning in all of its forms. CRADLE examines learning at multiple levels of granularity. By understanding learning within the individual, in a group, among a community, and dispersed through cyberspace, we seek to find new avenues for preparing learners for a changing world. Our pursuits range from examining what physically transpires in the brain and body during learning to analysing the impacts of what happens in the physical and virtual world because of learning. The translational research of CRADLE comes from widening the areas in which learning is studied, improving assessments of learning, and designing processes to rapidly bring proven innovations to scale in both traditional NTU classrooms and technology enhanced courses.​  ​​CRADLE’s Vision is driven by three thrusts of research: (i) Science of Learning; (ii) Learning Sciences; and (iii) Future Economy and Workforce Learning. The outcomes of CRADLE’s research thrusts contribute to the Centre’s SEED roles and goals: Serve as an activity and technology incubator for researching and transforming learning in higher education Enhance learning by developing effective technologies and mindful learning environment and activity designs supported by empirical research   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cradle/about-us'}, IndexData{title='Alumni | School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Local Internships Credit-bearing Internships In the curriculum structure at NTU, most students are required to undergo practical attachment in various organisations as part of their degree programmes. The period of attachment varies from 8 weeks to 24 weeks. The purposes of the attachment programmes are to supplement NTU's in-house practical professional training or/and to lessen the on-the-job training of these students when they graduate, as well as to instill in them the right kind of work attitude and work professionalism, so that they can become effective and productive to their respective organisations much sooner than is usual for fresh graduates.  Many of the organisations which have repeated participated in the internship programmes have cited the following benefits derived: • opportunity to evaluate and recruit potential employees, • additional manpower to supplement existing staff, and • fresh ideas and perspectives from enthusiastic students. Requirements Expected of Participating Organisations Participating organisation is required to: assign a supervisor, preferably an engineer or a professional staff to supervise the students and assess their work performance during their attachment period and provide a structured attachment programme, with emphasis on applications, management and hands-on experience for the student.  Allowance & Working Hours  The allowance to be paid to the student will be determined by the organisation. As a guide, most organisations are paying $1000 to $2000 per month (CPF exempted) for local attachment. This subsistence allowance paid to the student to meet his/her daily expenses. Students will follow the normal office working hours of the organisation on a five-day or five-and-a-half day week basis.  Work Permit or Training Pass An organisation taking in a foreign student who is full-time matriculated or registered student of NTU for local attachment under NTU's attachment programme is exempted from applying for a work permit or training pass in respect of that foreign student. Income Tax The allowance paid to the student is not liable for income tax in Singapore as long as there is no employment contract between the student and the participating organisation.  Insurance Students are covered against personal or bodily injuries caused by or arising out of accidents through a Group Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (24-hour worldwide) arranged by NTU. The University has also taken up a Public Liability Policy Insurance to indemnify organisations against claims and damages arising as a result of providing such training facilities. The territorial limits of this coverage are confined to attachment placements within Singapore and other ASEAN countries.    ^Physical & Mathematical Sciences 3rd / 4th Year CBC - Chemistry & Biological Chemistry PAP - Physics & Applied Physics MAS - Mathematical Sciences July to December (CBC, PAP & MAS) January to June (CBC, PAP & MAS) May to July (PAP & MAS)​ Biological Sciences 3rd and 4th Year ​July to December January to June​ ^ Environmental Earth Systems Science 3rd / 4th Year August to December January to May ^ Internships for these programmes are optional.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Double major Provided by The Double Major Programme is a four-year direct honours degree programme. Undergraduate students will read two majors chosen from among the disciplinary strengths of the four schools in the College, namely, the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), the School of Humanities (SoH), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). Unlike the existing single discipline-based degrees, this degree will feature two distinct majors within an innovative new structure. As such this is a fully conceived double-disciplinary degree. Students will be admitted into this Double Major degree programme at the point of entry to NTU, and declare their two majors at this point. During this four-year degree programme, undergraduates will read both their majors in both Economics and Media Analytics, benefiting from the expertise and resources of both the School of Social Sciences (SSS) and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). The Economics and Media Analytics curriculum combines a broad introduction to principles of economics and research methods for analysing media audiences and impact. By honing their expertise in both areas, students prepare for public and private sector careers in which they set the future direction for new media. Other NTU programmes are better suited for students who wish to learn other skills at the intersection of economics and communication, such as business or economics reporting. However, this curriculum is best suited for strategising for twenty-first media.

Encourage your URECA student to submit his/her URECA paper to the Undergraduate Awards Programme. All NTU & NIE faculty including full-time research-active Principal Lecturers, Senior Lecturers and Lecturers are eligible to participate in the URECA supervision as main supervisors. Visiting or adjunct faculty are also welcomed to participate in URECA supervision as a joint supervisor together with a full time NTU / NIE faculty who will act as the main supervisor. *Adjunct faculty may submit as main supervisors if their appointment period is within the duration of URECA Programme (1 August to mid-July; inclusive of mark entry period in 1st of week of July).  A faculty may supervise up to a maximum of 6 URECA students excluding FYP-URECA students. Each student must be registered to a research project.  Supervision of each URECA / FYP-URECA project is equivalent to supervising full FYP project in the respective school. If there is more than 1 supervising faculty involved, the workload would be divided in mutually agreed manner between the supervising faculty involved. URECA office does not get involved in the division of workload between faculty. There are 3 research project types: URECA is a research project proposed by NTU/NIE faculty IDR-URECA is an Interdisciplinary Research proposed by NTU/NIE faculty from two or more different academic disciplines (different schools) CLRI-URECA is an Industry Research proposed by Principal Investigators (PI) or Researchers from NTU Corporate Labs and Research Institutes There is no limit to the number of project proposals a faculty can submit in the system.   URECA has forged collaborations with National Labora​​tories and Research Institutes to enable URECA students to meaningfully situate their theoretical knowledge in actual research work as well as to facilitate quality industry exposure. IDR-URECA is an Interdisciplinary Research proposed by NTU/NIE faculty from two or more different academic disciplines (different schools) to provide URECA students with Interdisciplinary Research experience. Faculty may select one or two other faculty from different schools to jointly prepare a n Interdisciplinary Research-URECA (IDR-URECA) project proposal to be uploaded in URECA project proposal system through Staff Intranet. Faculty who do not have an Interdisciplinary research collaborator(s), may access the Research Directory to identify their co-supervisors. Mutual agreement is needed on the responsibility for IDR-URECA project. The tasks of proposal upload, approval of student’s project consumables claims, URECA deliverables (poster, abstract, paper & reflection of research experience) and mark entry will be made by one supervisor who is the default owner. The ownership can be changed to any of the co-supervisors if necessary, any time before the start of project. CLRI-URECA is an Industry Research proposed by Principal Investigators (PI) or Researchers from NTU Corporate Labs and Research Institutes to provide URECA students with research industry experience in a multidisciplinary environment. Principal Investigators (PI) or Researchers from NTU Corporate Labs and Autonomous Institutions prepare a research project proposal to be uploaded in URECA project proposal system through Staff Intranet. The URECA system is an Intranet application which require NTU email account and Staff Intranet access as the main supervisor at present.  Access to URECA system is required by main supervisor to key-in research project proposal and to conduct all URECA student actions such as viewing submissions, marks entry etc.  (PI or researchers are required to write in to URECA Programme office at URECA@ntu.edu.sg to request access to URECA project proposals system with their NTU email ID if they are participating in URECA supervision for the first time.) Other the other hand, students may have self-initiated research projects and approach faculty to be their supervisors. Faculty will assess the suitability of the student(s) for the project as well as their academic and extra-curricular commitments. Faculty will choose to accept or reject the student(s) and register the student to the project via Staff Intranet when there is mutual interest. Each URECA project can only be registered to one eligible student. If a faculty would like to supervisor another eligible student, he/she has to upload another URECA project proposal with slight differentiation in project title to register the student via Staff Intranet. Please ensure that you have submitted a project proposal before you can proceed to register a student. ​​To Register a Student: Step 1: Go to Staff Intranet > More Services > Student - Related Services > Academic > URECA > Registration Step 2: Select Register/Deregister Student option Step 3: Select the project you wish to register student > select the student and click Register button​  *If student is not eligible for URECA, his/ her name will not appear in the drop down list for registration ​To Deregister a Student during Add/Drop period: Step 1: Go to Staff Intranet > More Services > Student - Related Services > Academic > URECA > Registration Step 2: Select Register/Deregister Student option Step 3: Select the project you wish to register student > select the student and click Deregister button​ *The above de-registration option is not available to supervisor AFTER the Add/Drop period. Deregister request after Add/Drop period Student who wish to withdraw from URECA Programme after the Add/Drop period, is required to submit an official withdrawal application. More information on deregistration . Following the university course registration guideline, a student who is still registered for a course after the Add/Drop period but did not subsequently complete the course will be deemed to have read and failed the course. URECA is similar to taking a course where student will be graded by his/her supervisor, e.g. if student did not sit for exams/ submit the required deliverables, the student will not receive a pass grade. URECA is a 11-months (August to June) research programme. Students must be available for at least 1 semester in NTU if they are going on Internship or Exchange Programme (e.g. GEM Discoverer, GEM Explorer etc.). They are strongly encouraged to discuss their detailed plan with the supervisor for mutual agreement before enrolling in the URECA programme. As projects have different requirements, it is important to consider each case prior to enrolling.  Students are expected to work on URECA research projects for 11 months including periods of their Internship or Exchange Programme and manage their time accordingly to the satisfaction of their supervising professors. The URECA deliverables (Poster in end of January, Abstract in end of May, Research Paper & Reflection of research in end of June) are submitted via Student Intranet.   Each URECA project can only be registered to one URECA eligible student. If a faculty would like to supervise another URECA eligible student, he/she may upload another URECA project with a differentiated project title as shown in the example below from school of MAE. URECA students can work on their research project as a team, however they need to submit their individual URECA deliverables by the stipulated deadline. Theme of research project: Flight dynamics Project Title Student Name   The maximum number of student registration per Professor is capped at 6 URECA students in any URECA project type (excluding FYP-URECA students).    The URECA programme is a 4AUs unrestricted elective (UE), which is part of the General Education Requirement (GER) curriculum. The subject "Undergraduate Research" will be reflected as a 'Pass' or 'Fail' grade in all successfully registered URECA students' transcripts in the following academic year (August). Pass/fail grade will not have any bearings on the computation of students' GPA. URECA grading is not applicable to FYP-URECA students. There is no additional AUs from URECA for FYP-URECA project as AUs are awarded by respective students' schools.  URECA Certificate will only be issued to students who submit major URECA deliverables (Research poster*, abstract, research paper* and reflection of research experience) by the stipulated submission deadlines and obtain pass grade for URECA. *Posters/ papers rejected by supervisors must be resubmitted within 3 days after submission deadline FYP-URECA Certificate will only be issued to students who have submitted all FYP-URECA deliverables that are accepted by their supervising professors by the stipulated deadline. *The below deliverables apply to FYP-URECA students with the exception of Workshops & Quiz.  Weightage Date Length  Deliverables Submission 15%        - Workshops & Quiz *Workshops 1 to 3 for first time URECA students *Workshops 4 to 6 for returning URECA students Online Quiz during workshops session 20% End-Mar 1 poster Softcopy of one exibit-able research poster Template will be provided.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Helping students wade through troubled financial waters From financial challenges in school to business success today, alumnus Steven Lim’s story is one of perseverance. Today, the NTU benefactor is committed to supporting students grappling with similar financial challenges. By Sadia Roohi Steven Lim (3rd from right) with some RSTN Scholarship and Bursary beneficiaries. NTU student Paul (3rd from left) will continue to mentor his juniors after graduation. Steven Lim’s (WKWSCI/2008) life story is marked by resilience and determination. Growing up in challenging circumstances, he faced financial difficulties as his family relied on his fisherman father. A gambling addict, his father racked up debts with illegal moneylenders who started harassing the family. He then fled to Vietnam and did not return for many years or provide any financial support. As a result, Steven had to work multiple jobs to put himself through school and university. After graduating from university with a bachelor’s degree, Steven worked at a company for six to seven years where in 1997, he helped secure an international bid, bringing in US$80 million. Motivated by this, he started his business with three partners in 1998, despite the Asian financial crisis. However, 1999 was a challenging year for Steven and his partners as they worked hard to secure an important project, even dipping into their savings. Moreover, Steven’s father returned and was diagnosed with last-stage colorectal cancer. Steven’s savings were further depleted, and the team faced the possibility of dissolution if the project didn't materialise. The tides turned in December 1999 when they emerged victorious, clinching the deal and receiving a much-needed lifeline of US$10 million. His dedication and hard work eventually led to him becoming the Group CEO and founder of RSTN Consulting, a company providing Enterprise Content Management, Business Process Management and Cyber Security solutions to countries across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Steven, who completed an MSc in Knowledge Management from NTU’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) in 2008, and graduated as top student in his cohort, empathises with the struggles of needy students and is keen to help them. "My goal is to ensure that students from low-income backgrounds will not have to struggle all by themselves,” said Steven. “It stems from my own situation back then when I had no financial means to enter university and literally had to beg and borrow. I hope my gifts can improve the lives of bright minds that require a bit of help while wading through troubled waters." He decided to give back to society after a near-death experience in 2010 when he suffered a heart attack while overseas. The life-altering event prompted him to make giving back an essential part of his mission in life and business, alongside taking better care of his health. Group CEO and Founder of RSTN Consulting Steven Lim with NTU’s Chief Development Officer Ms See E’jin at the launch of the "林芝锋 Lin Zhi Feng Seminar Room” in NTU’s Gaia. After establishing the RSTN Scholarship and Bursary Fund in 2021 , Steven recently made another gift to NTU’s Endowment Fund. In recognition of his philanthropic gesture, a seminar room at NTU’s Gaia academic building has been named “林芝锋 Lin Zhi Feng Seminar Room”. He has also provided emergency grants to students facing extreme financial difficulties, some of whom were unable to afford proper daily meals. A mentor figure to students His commitment goes beyond financial contributions. He actively engages with his scholarship and bursary recipients, fostering a sense of community and encouragement. During the room’s unveiling ceremony in February, Steven met several student recipients from the RSTN Scholarship and Bursary Fund. He shared five keys to success: passion, belief, strategy, good health, and networking. Paul Solomon Low, a final-year Business and Computer Science student and the recipient of the RSTN Scholarship, will embark on a career with Citi after graduation. Steven has inspired him to give back to NTU by supporting his juniors. “I appreciate how Mr Steven Lim encourages us to develop a heart for society and pay it forward. I have, albeit in a much smaller way, mentored my NTU juniors in the same extracurricular activities and encouraged them to do the same for others,” he said. Another student, Ivan Tan, a final-year Biological Sciences and Psychology undergraduate and an RSTN Bursary recipient, also appreciates his interactions with Steven.  "Receiving the bursary has helped me overcome financial constraints and opened doors to new opportunities. I am thankful for the financial support, which allows me to pursue my interests in research and boating,” said Ivan. Final year Biological Sciences and Psychology undergraduate Ivan Tan, a recipient of the RSTN Bursary, could pursue opportunities without worrying too much about his financial situation. Inspired by Steven’s generosity, Ivan aims to pay it forward. He said, “The person I am today is the result of many individuals who willingly contributed time and resources into nurturing me. There will come a day when a wide-eyed student comes to me for guidance, and I will use my capacity to give back and help others grow as well.”  As an NTU alumnus, Steven felt a strong connection to the university and a sense of duty to give back. He said, "I hope that the students pay it forward in the future when they are working and are able to become donors so that more needy students can benefit. Being generous is always so rewarding and fulfilling.” Emphasising the importance of collective efforts, Steven said, “Alumni who are in a comfortable financial situation should step forward and do their small part in giving back to NTU. They may also donate to my current scholarship or bursary fund to support more students. Their contributions, no matter the amount, will help NTU and its students in a significant way."

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Ivan Sim shares his fondest memories of hall life and what makes NTU home. Even though NTU is far away from my house, during my time in school, I can still feel the same warmth that I felt at home. During the first two years of university, I stayed in a student hall on campus, and it was the most meaningful experience of my entire university life My roommate was my secondary school friend whom I had known for more than 10 years. I will never forget those fun times we had when we were roommates - staying up late together to study, waking up early to go for morning runs, having dinner together, and our late-night talks. Most memorable were the frequent supper sessions where we would cook and create our own version of healthy dry instant noodles. I also had an enjoyable time with peers I met through my hall orientation camp. Staying in the same compound had not only brought us closer but also gave us the opportunity to create a closely-knit community - a “kampong”. Luckily, before COVID started, my friends and I managed to enjoy some overseas experience as a group. We went for a day trip to Johor Bahru where we had 7 meals in a single day, and even a 3-days 2 nights trip to Batam. The one time that we all looked forward to the most would probably be the Christmas season, because that was when we would organise a get-together party with the Secret Santa activity being the main highlight of the night. My hostel experience was unique, enjoyable, memorable, and warm. My roommates and hallmates are more than just friends I met in school. As time passed, a sense of camaraderie was forged, and they are no longer just my friends, but more like my family. Not only did we have fun when we lived near one another, we also took care of each other, and helped one another when in need. Although I no longer stay at the hostel during my final year, the friendships forged were deep and we are still close. Regardless of our busy schedules, we still try to meet and catch up for meals or bonding activities. Another key reason why NTU felt like a home to me would be its accessibility to amenities, food, and facilities. NTU is like a town on its own with everything you need from hair salons and grocery shops to sports and leisure facilities. It is as though you are living in a small town with all the other students. I may have only stayed in hostel for only less than two years, but the friendships I have forged will last me a lifetime.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student A global citizen Snap Inc's APAC President, Ajit Mohan (SCSE/1997), shares how his journey around the world has made him an agile and versatile leader. Text: Derek Rodriguez Earlier this year, Ajit Mohan returned to Singapore, where he last lived 20 years ago, to lead the Asia Pacific region for Snap Inc as its President. Most recently, he spent more than a decade in India between his roles as Vice President and Managing Director of Meta and the founding CEO of Hotstar. “After a series of career relocations that have taken me from Singapore to North America, Europe, Latin America and India, I am excited to be back at the heart of Asia at a time when there is yet another big and exciting transformation underway in the region,” says Ajit. Graduating with a degree in computer engineering from NTU, he spent the first 10 years of his career in management consulting, where his work put him in a different environment every few months. “The locations and companies changed, and so did the market. I would move from working for a family-owned media company in Brazil one month to the public school system in Cincinnati in the US the next month. The only way I could keep up and make an impact was to develop the ability to switch gears quickly,” says the 2023 Nanyang Alumni Achievement Award winner. NTU and Singapore provided the springboard for Ajit to pursue a diverse and global life and career. His international experience, he adds, has enabled him to seek and appreciate diversity, and be open to new ideas, people and opportunities. However, he didn’t always have such an expansive perspective on life. Taking the first flight of his life at 18 and relocating from a small company township in a corner of Kerala in South India to Singapore was a huge culture shock and left him feeling homesick. “This feeling prevented me from embracing the exciting things that came with my new life in Singapore,” he says. “The shift in mindset I made was to recognise that with every new place comes the opportunity to colour in a fresh canvas. That is true when it comes to making new friends and finding new avenues of learning and professional growth.” Soon, Ajit’s leadership would shine through when he was elected to the NTU Students’ Union in 1994 and was appointed its Vice President. He was also part of the debating team representing NTU at multiple World, Australasian and Asian Debating Championships between 1994 and 1997.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Small gestures, big impact From feeding the underprivileged in Cambodia to mentoring undergraduates in Singapore, NTU graduates Pengty Ngor (EEE/2009) and Joyce Liang (NBS/2005) believe every contribution counts. Text: Christopher Ong  The world changed for Pengty Ngor when he enrolled as an NTU undergrad to study Engineering in 2005. He says he benefitted immensely from his “formative” undergraduate experience, taking up as many learning opportunities as he could while also participating actively in co-curricular activities. As a student member in various associations, he helped to organise charity initiatives such as book donation drives to help needy children. He found the activities meaningful and it motivated him to want to do more. When the international student returned home to Cambodia, he yearned to maintain his ties with NTU. So, Pengty, 35, started an NTU Alumni Association there as a platform for the more than 200 alumni in Cambodia to network and stay connected to the University. One regular activity he organises is a monthly run which serves to promote a healthy lifestyle amongst alumni, while allowing them to meet old friends and make new ones. Pengty, who runs his own company with businesses in education, financial and healthcare services, wanted to impart the values of service that he had learnt during his years as an NTU student. So, he started organising donation drives and distributes rice, noodles, stationery, and even bicycles to underprivileged children in his community. In 2016, Pengty launched a weekly food distribution programme, which delivers 80 meals – rice and different Khmer dishes ranging from soup to meat – to needy families. The programme is supported by donations as well as his own financial contributions. “Positive acts may inspire others to follow your footsteps, and the impact will be long-lasting. You can start by planning your goal and daring to dream big, and then working your way towards it,” says Pengty. Kindness begets kindness One good turn deserves another. Upon learning of his charitable efforts, his friends in Singapore were inspired to start their own lunch programme called “Lunch for Kids” that provided about 200 primary school students from Cambodia’s Pursat province with a meal every day for three years. Pengty says providing a meal for these children has the added benefit of encouraging them to continue attending school and reducing the dropout rate. He adds: “There are people who live with abundance while others may even lack food. I find that just a small donation from some people can make a difference to others’ lives.”   Mentoring as a ‘privilege’ Supporting fresh graduates as they transition into the corporate world. Early in her career, Nanyang Business School (NBS) alumna Joyce Liang (Class of 2005) had mentors who guided her as she navigated the corporate world. Having benefitted from the experience, she decided to do the same. She now volunteers with NBS’ Step Out programme aimed at helping undergraduates transition into the workforce.  Joyce, who is the Global Commercial Director at Dyson, says: “It can be pretty daunting for someone who is starting out in the corporate world. If you can be in a position to offer support to someone else, in this case to mentor someone, why not?” As part of her volunteer work with young graduates, she helps them with a range of things from resume-writing, preparing for job interviews to sharing tips on how to survive and thrive in their first job. Joyce, 38, adds that being a mentor has also helped her gain insight into challenges faced by the current generation of graduates. “I think this generation has gone through something completely different versus the rest of us who were trained in the pre-pandemic world. They had to quickly adapt and acquire a different skillset to stand out and thrive, as well as put in double the effort to connect with others in the virtual space.”   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/small-gestures-big-impact'}, IndexData{title='Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Double Major - History and Linguistics and Multilingual Studies | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Double major Provided by The Double Major Programme is a four-year direct honours degree programme. Undergraduate students will read two majors chosen from among the disciplinary strengths of the four schools in the College, namely, the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), the School of Humanities (SoH), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). Unlike the existing single discipline-based degrees, this degree will feature two distinct majors within an innovative new structure. As such this is a fully conceived double-disciplinary degree. Each major will have equal weightage. Students will be admitted into this Double Major degree programme at the point of entry to NTU, and declare their two majors at this point. During this four-year degree programme, undergraduates will read both LMS and history, benefiting from the expertise and resources of both programmes. The History Programme seeks to train students to not only think critically but also to apply interdisciplinary methods to identify and address contemporary problems from historical perspectives. History graduates will master the secondary literature in their chosen areas of study, engage in independent research, exercise critical judgment about the texts that they encounter, and communicate their findings in a well-reasoned and scholarly manner. The Linguistics and Multilingual Studies curriculum allows students to explore the many interesting facets of language and communication, from the properties of speech sounds to grammatical and discourse structure, from children’s language development to communication in bilingual and multilingual societies. 4-Year Direct Honours Programme   Equal Weightage   Degree Scroll   Flexible You may apply to change your programme after your first year.

Put your skills to practice in the Final Year Project. Curriculum Overview Single Degree Our graduates are highly sought after across a wide variety of careers in industries such as:   As part of the first graduating class from the Maritime Studies programme, I am very appreciative of the School’s effort in setting up this groundbreaking programme, the first degree programme in Singapore for maritime. I spent the last twelve and half years in shipping finance, the first 11 years with NORD/LB Singapore and now with CCB Financial Leasing in China. Shipping finance has been an important part of the maritime industry, as it provides funding support that is critical to the sector. My four years of studies at NTU have provided me with ample knowledge required to succeed in the industry. The programme curricula covered finance and accounting subjects, together with courses closely related to the shipping, such as chartering, insurance and maritime law. You will not only be learning one aspect of the industry but its full picture from an international perspective. Shipping is truly an international business.   Sector: Government​ Deputy Director Maritime & Port Authority, Singapore (as of 2022) I am currently the Assistant Director of the International Maritime Centre (IMC) Promotion team in MPA. I head the Asia team within the Department, and we work closely with ship owners and operators that are Asia-headquartered, partnering them to set up offices in Singapore and identifying programmes that will enable them to further entrench their business operations here. It has been a very enriching experience for me, getting to interact with maritime companies, build and maintain relationships with them; during the COVID-19 pandemic, I also help them to address their problems and ensure that the maritime industry continues to be resilient.​​​ It has been useful to me that the NTU Maritime Studies programme had an industry focus, involving maritime practitioners to share their experiences with us in classes. This equipped me with rich background knowledge of the maritime industry even before I joined the workforce, making the learning curve at work less steep. Opportunities such as internships with maritime companies during my studies, the overseas semester-long exchange during which we visited Norwegian companies to better understand the industry from the perspective of another maritime nation, are some of the most memorable parts of the programme. Till today, I remain in close contact with my fellow course mates and friends, many of whom are now in various sectors of the industry (such as chartering, marine insurance, ship operations). Shipping is the lifeblood of the Singapore economy, and the maritime industry is a diverse and multifaceted one, with many exciting career opportunities. I hope you will enjoy the journey of learning more about this industry!​​​​​​​​​​ Su Weixiang Maritime Studies, Class of 2011​ Sector: Ship Management & Chartering General Manager, J. Lauritzen (as of 2022) Heading the Pacific Desk for J. Lauritzen Bulkers involves running our trading position as well as managing a team of energetic intellects. The joy of learning every day keeps me on my toes. Making market calls with sometimes limited information and data requires rallying a good team around to make the best calculated move. The broad curriculum that Maritime Studies offered had certainly given me an edge in executing my duties. From oceanography to maritime technology, and chartering to project management, these are skill sets that can be applied to problem solving on a daily basis. The ball is always grey when you put black and white together and there is no true or false in shipping but only consequences. This is why shipping is a reflection of life and I would say it is a way of life! A key to staying relevant in the industry is to accept different cultures and you can begin by challenging yourself to work on projects with people outside your circle and comfort zone.​​ Yuen Kum Fai Sector: Academic Assistant Professor in Maritime Studies, Nanyang Technological University (as of 2022) I am an Assistant Professor in Maritime Studies at Nanyang Technological University. My job scope includes research, teaching and service. I find my job enriching and satisfying because it involves advancing our knowledge about managing maritime business environment, nurturing the future generation, and supporting our local maritime industry. The Maritime Studies programme provides a holistic coverage of the maritime industry covering economic, management, legal, regulation technology and environmental aspects. The programme has equipped me with the necessary knowledge to pursue and complete further studies. The knowledge that I have acquired has remained largely relevant and is used in my research. The best memories that I have during my studies at the Maritime Studies programme would be the relationships that I have built with my friends and the exciting visit to Oslo, Norway for a semester-long exchange. Living, travelling and studying abroad with my course mates are truly memorable.   Sector: Marine Insurance Group Insurance & Claims Manager, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (as of 2020) As Group Insurance & Claims Manager, I am responsible for the insurance and claims matters for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement globally. My responsibilities include, amongst others, insurance placement, renewals and maintaining an overview and management of the claims which are handled by my team. My job scope also extends beyond the usual marine insurances as I am involved in other aspects of the business, assessing organisational risks and sourcing for appropriate insurance covers whenever necessary. In my role, I get to work with various people within the organisation and external parties such as insurance brokers, underwriters and clients which makes it enjoyable and challenging. Each claim, as well as the ever-changing risk environment and needs, are unique and presents new learning opportunities, thus making the job less mundane. No day is the same as the one before. ​​​​​​​NTU Maritime Studies programme has equipped me well with the knowledge of the maritime industry beyond just the ports we see every day. It helped me to draw connections between various stakeholders in the industry and understand the importance of each role that makes the sector thrive. More importantly, it opens the door to a myriad of opportunities within this big global industry. The friendships that I have made at NTU forms the best memories of my time as an undergraduate. From the times we studied and worked on projects together, to going on exchange together as a cohort that made a close-knitted group, and finally as working adults who are all in the same industry where we share the joys and woes that all of us can resonate with. These memories and experiences last a lifetime. ​​​​​​​To the existing students and potential applicants, we look forward to meeting or working with you some day in future! The industry needs and will always keep its doors open for young and motivated individuals.​​​ Wang Wenxiu Charlotte  Maritime Studies, Class of 2016 Sector: Supply Chain & Logistics Senior Manager, Supply Chain, Proctor & Gamble (as of 2022) I am currently working in Proctor & Gamble as a Supply Chain Manager, focusing on Demand Planning. I am responsible for developing volume forecast for our products which guides business and production plans. The forecast is developed based on historical consumption data, latest commercial inputs and supply constraints. I truly enjoy the job as it is not only intellectually challenging but also provides the opportunity to interact with multiple functions in the company. The curriculum in NTU Maritime Studies has broadened my horizon on integrated global supply chain. Upon graduation, I joined a shipping company as a Management Trainee which enabled me to utilize my maritime knowledge and gain insights on real-world operations. At work, I was also given the opportunity to manage other supply chain related businesses which sparked my interest to learn more about this field and did a part-time masters in supply chain management. I appreciate my education in NTU Maritime Studies which provided me with an eye-opening experience and good foundation for all supply chain related roles. My best memory of NTU Maritime Studies would be the MPA-sponsored Global Internship Programme when I spent 2 months in Denmark with a top-notch shipping company. The internship has given me valuable international exposure and more in-depth understanding of the maritime industry. Eugene Lim Maritime Studies, Class of 2019​ Sector: Port Management Terminal Stowage Planner, PSA Singapore (as of 2020) I am currently a terminal stowage planner in PSA Singapore. I plan and ensure that stowage profiles of incoming container vessels are well optimized, keeping in mind that 'stability' is of utmost priority as there are lives onboard the vessels. As the world's busiest transhipment port, PSA Singapore is beaming with vessels awaiting to berth for cargo operations. Thus, with a good stowage plan, smooth operations can then be executed by the frontline operations team to turnaround vessels quickly before serving the next vessel. My job is satisfying as I am facilitating and connecting global trade. ​​​​​​​With a strong foundation and knowledge that NTU MS has provided me over the years, I have an edge over my peers in terms of port and shipping knowledge. I am then able to share my knowledge in the field with my peers. Most importantly, NTU MS has taught me the importance of persevering through tough moments and that anything can be achieved, if we pour our heart and soul into it. Being away with my friends and experiencing the culture in Europe during my semester-long exchange programme in Norway was the best memory of my time in NTU MS. I also missed the jokes and laughter that my friends shared amongst preparing for assignments, tests and examinations. ​​​​​​​Singapore's roots have always been its seaport and is now an internationally acclaimed maritime centre. As the industry is tight knitted, it is important to get to know your batchmates, seniors and juniors alike and network well starting from school. The people around you are your future connections!​​ Muhammad Nawazsher Khan Sector: Shipbroking Shipbroker Executive, Strait Shipbroker (as of 2020) Currently I am a shipbroker at Strait Shipbroker specialising in the Chemicals and Vegetable Oil Products. The role of a shipbroker is to assist in fixing contractual deals between the Charterers and Shipowners. The kind of ships that I handle are mainly Tankers and they carry cargoes either in full load or in smaller parcels. Every segment of the industry has its own characteristics. Coming from a background of Dry Bulk, I am continuously learning at my current role in the Wet Bulk segment. It requires considerable amount of interaction with different market players. Building relationships with the different parties is a very important aspect of the job as a shipbroker. I enjoy my current role as I would describe myself to be outgoing. I dislike spending most of my time staring at my screen the whole day punching into the keyboard. The NTU Maritime Studies covers a rather wide scope of the maritime industry, ranging from Maritime Law to Port Planning, to Warehousing and Distribution. The fundamental and broad knowledge allows graduates to explore numerous career opportunities upon graduation. The instructors are very experienced in their respective fields and it exposes the students not only to the theoretical aspects but also the real-life experiences, which allow student to receive a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Many of my batchmate would definitely agree that the Exchange Programme that the programme had in store for us during our Year 3 is a memorable experience. My exchange programme was in Oslo, Norway where we spent 1 semester experiencing a different culture and learning environment, and also the travelling that we manage to slip in between our semester breaks. In addition, I was awarded the MPA Global Internship Award, which sponsors awardees (most of which are from NTU Maritime Studies) to do internship with a Maritime company both in their local and overseas branch. I had the privilege to spend 6 weeks in the Singapore office and 4 weeks in the London office. Working abroad is definitely a different experience altogether unlike travelling as tourist. It broadened my perspective as an individual to the different working environment and skills required. Lim Hong Yu Maritime Studies, Class of 2019​ Sector: Energy Trading Energy Trader, Centrica Energy Trading (as of 2020) I am currently working as a trader at Centrica Energy Trading. I find my job satisfying because I am constantly challenged to make the best possible decisions with the available market information. The decisions that I make directly affects the company’s performance, so it gives me a great sense of empowerment and ownership. I also enjoy keeping up with the commodity markets and monitoring how different geopolitical events influence gas, oil, coal and LNG prices. Understanding the intricacies behind the markets are of great importance. Maritime studies have given us a broad perspective of what goes on in the shipping industry and how the industry plays a huge part in the global transportation, be it container shipping or dry/wet cargoes. It is the backbone of global trade and certainly cannot be overlooked by anyone. The International Trading Programme (ITP) specialisation has provided me significant exposure to commodity trading and the related companies. I am forever grateful for the education as it has opened an exciting career path that I foresee myself to be working in for years to come. The best memories of my time at NTU Maritime Studies? Hands down, the overseas exchange in Norway with my close friends where we probably had the time of our lives. How I wish I can relive those memories! My message to potential applicants on enrolling in NTU Maritime Studies is to keep an open mind, read as much as you can about the industry and be daring to speak up and go beyond your books! This is an industry knowledge driven sector. Besides the curriculum, your most valuable knowledge might be gained through your internships and knowing the right people. ​​​​​ Ng Sen Mian Sector: Energy Transportation & Infrastructure Services Management Trainee, BW Group (as of 2020) I am currently a management trainee with BW Group. I am given the opportunity to rotate across the various business units within the organization and am currently serving a rotation with the LNG team. I assist the business development team in analyzing and developing new business opportunities to deploy our assets into the LNG market. Generating useful insights to help the business development team make informed decisions as well as learning from my experienced colleagues brings me satisfaction, knowing that I am learning and contributing at the same time. My time in NTU Maritime Studies have allowed me to understand the maritime industry better, equipping me with the relevant skills to grasp important concepts in shipping. Group work and discussions foster interaction and communication, while our professors impart fundamental shipping concepts to us during classes. Being comfortable with speaking up improves communication at the workplace while the concepts we learned in school reduces the knowledge gap when joining the industry. The best memories of my time in NTU Maritime Studies would be my semester exchange to Norway. Apart from experiencing a different education system, we were able to visit various countries to experience different cultures as well. This promotes cultural intelligence, allowing us to improve cross-cultural communication which is a common sight given how international the shipping industry is. In addition, travelling with friends made the entire experience better as we had plenty of fun and memorable experiences together. To potential applicants, do consider this program as an introduction to an international and dynamic industry. To existing students, learning does not stop outside the classroom. Look to expand your personal growth and development through various means such as discussions, seminar events, and internships. Cheryl Teng Maritime Studies, Class of 2020​ Sector: Oil & Gas Trading Trading Executive, TOTAL Trading Asia (as of 2020) ​​​Currently, I am working as a Trading Executive at TOTAL Trading Asia Pte Ltd, focusing on the Petrochemical market. My role is basically the middleman/coordinator between the different counterparties. After the trader has clinched a deal, I will take over the physical deliveries. My job encompasses coordinating with all involving parties and to provide necessary instructions for vessels to load and discharge their cargo. As an oil trading operator, I have to understand the refining process for the products that I am handling in terms of their specifications and quality. This is important as there are certain restrictions to adhere to when transporting petrochemical products in a tanker for safety purposes. So far, I feel most satisfied when I complete the whole cycle of a shipment/deal. The challenges that I faced during each shipment excites and frustrates me at the same time, but I guess that is what make this job interesting. You learn to handle a variety of scenarios with different parties involved and get to know about how trading works too. The Incoterms and Shipping terms (e.g., laytime and demurrage) that I learnt in NTU Maritime Studies have prepared me well in understanding the delivery terms for each shipment. I could also better position myself when coordinating with the ship master, as I have once personally experience how working onboard the vessel is like during my internship. This rare opportunity to be onboard was part of my internship programme that NTU partnered with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, called MPA Global Internship Award. The exchange programme during Year 3 to Norway was the best memories I forged during my time at NTU Maritime Studies. Studying abroad in a new environment and making friends from different countries has allow me to see how diverse the world is, just like shipping. If you are curious about how shipping interconnects with the different part of the world, come join NTU Maritime Studies and understand how shipping plays an important role in international trading.​​​ Tan Xin Hui Sector: Market Intelligence Infrastructure & Marine Research Analyst, Clarksons Research (as of 2021) ​​​Currently, I am working as an Infrastructure & Marine Research Analyst in the Clarksons Research. My main role encompasses data research as well as the management of various databases and data sources related to the marine infrastructure segment. For example, as environmental regulations aimed at decarbonising the maritime sector has been accelerating, I have also been increasingly involved in the primary market research of various alternative fuel projects, including LNG, Ammonia, and other fuel types. Additionally, I was also given opportunities to take on more responsibilities which include the production of monthly reports covering the ports and infrastructure sector as well as global vessel movement statistics. I find my job satisfying as I’m constantly challenged to think of alternative solutions to different scenarios, which also help to broaden my perspectives. The Maritime Studies programme had not only provided me with diverse knowledge of the maritime industry, but also other supporting functions such as shipping and commodity trading. The insights and industry experiences shared by our professors provided us the competitive edge and they remain useful to my current work. In addition, the flexible curriculum structure allowed us to take up modules beyond the Maritime curriculum. I enrolled in a foreign language class and a few modules related to cultural intelligence, which eventually helped me in my research work and adapting well in a culturally diverse work environment. My best memories are the relationship that I’ve built with my classmates and the time spent working on my FYP (Final-Year Project). I’ve also enjoyed my summer exchange in Korea as well as the various food hunts in NTU with my classmates after examinations!

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Forging her career path in sustainability In conjunction with Earth Day, we speak to NTU School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) alumna Dr Lee Hui Mien, one of Singapore’s pioneers in circular economy with almost two decades of sustainability research and industry experience. By Nur Isyana Isaman Sustainability is a buzzword today, but it was almost unheard of in 2003 when Dr Lee Hui Mien (EEE/2003) started her PhD journey at NTU after graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.  While brainstorming her PhD topic, Dr Lee was keen to combine her educational background in engineering and her passion for environmental causes, which she nurtured throughout her growing years, including being the ninth president of Earthlink NTU. “Electronic gadgets were becoming prevalent then, which eventually led to a lot of e-waste. That was one of the main reasons why, in my PhD from 2003 to 2009, I looked into closed-loop product life cycle management – now known as circular economy – to research a methodology that can help designers develop electronic products with less environmental impact by improving the product end-of-life management,” said Dr Lee. Leading corporate sustainability Today, the 43-year-old is one of the local pioneers in her field. Over the past 11 years, she has led corporate sustainability at IKEA Southeast Asia, followed by Singapore’s Mandai Park, and now at Singtel, where she is the Senior Director for Group Environmental Sustainability. Dr Lee Hui Mien (standing, third from left) with her Singtel colleagues during their Environmental Sustainability Day 2024. “Corporate sustainability comes down to how you do more business with less environmental impact and more societal impact. In every role I am in, I need to quickly understand the industry and its commerciality to work on the best way to move the company towards sustainability,” said Dr Lee.  Describing sustainability as a change management function, Dr Lee says the biggest challenge is rallying support at the start of a new project. To tackle this, she sets out a sustainability vision that is relatable to different groups of stakeholders across the entire organisation.  She explained, “When people start to relate and understand, they will start to change and collaborate with you to test new things. I tell people, I am not here to make you do extra work, but I am asking you to convert a small part, maybe about 20%, of what you currently do into sustainable practices. Sustainability investment is no different from technology investment.” Another critical challenge is debunking the common misconception that sustainability requires spending more money and thus can only be done by big companies. “The idea that sustainability is a luxury is not true. It is a matter of looking into what and how your company can contribute to sustainability. When done well, sustainability becomes a very strong business proposition. It is no longer a good-to-have, but a must-have for companies to be sustainable.” Pursuing sustainability research Before moving into corporate sustainability, Dr Lee spent the first six years of her career as a research scientist at the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology.  Her projects included the successful collaboration with Nanyang Optical to develop an award-winning eyewear frame that is mostly made of recycled materials, which she believes is the world’s first of its kind. The entire frame is made using recycled plastic, except the silicone nose pads.  She was also a key member of the team that established the Sustainable Manufacturing Centre in 2009 with support from 27 partner companies and government agencies.  However, treading a path in sustainability innovation research, which was still novel then, was not easy. She said, “In the late 2000s to early 2010s, it was unheard of to work in the sustainability function, let alone do sustainability research. The environment was not as conducive and vibrant as it is now. I started my first carbon footprinting project in 2008; it was unconventional then but as a result of research becoming mainstream, everyone talks about carbon footprinting in their products these days.” Reminiscing about her journey, Dr Lee is grateful to her professors for supporting her in taking the first step into sustainability research.  “NTU and A*STAR gave me the opportunity to pursue what I wanted to do in my PhD thesis at a time when not many people in Singapore pursued sustainability. I cherish that, and I am really thankful to my supervisors, Prof Robert Gay and Dr Lu Wen Feng, who gave me the freedom and luxury to choose my topic and continue with it.” To give back to her alma mater, Dr Lee shares her expertise regularly through guest lectures and industry talks. She has also served on the NTU Alumni Council and Graduate College Advisory Board since 2016. She was honoured with the School of EEE Alumni Service Award in 2022 and the Nanyang Outstanding Young Alumni Award in 2010.  Dr Lee (second from left) speaking at an industry talk for NTU alumni in May 2023. Here are five tips from Dr Lee for budding sustainability professionals: Know the basics of sustainability, such as carbon accounting.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/forging-her-career-path-in-sustainability'}, IndexData{title='NTU Alumni Homecoming | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Communicating well as a data scientist Mr Syed Zaheen feels the ability to work as a team and present findings is crucial, but so is communicating well as a data scientist. PHOTO (LEFT): SPH MEDIA/FRENCHESCAR LIM If curiosity is a skill highly sought after at the workplace, Mr Syed Zaheen will probably outshine many of his peers. During his National Service years, he tried his hand at building apps. In his free time, he watched YouTube videos on topics ranging from psychology and maths to philosophy. At university, Mr Syed’s priority was to take time to explore his interests, however diverse they may be. It was why he applied for the NTU-University Scholars Programme (NTU-USP) which offers interdisciplinary courses across the sciences, engineering, humanities and social sciences, with opportunities for various overseas programmes. While the quantitative nature of his major in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence might seem at odds with the interdisciplinary NTU-USP curriculum, Mr Syed believes they complement each other. For example, as part of his modules, he got to dabble in ethnographic fieldwork on heritage conservation and sustainability. One of his overseas trips brought him to Ipoh where he presented findings about preserving the town’s heritage as a former mining settlement that was dependent on Chinese immigrant labour. “The ability to work as a team and present findings is always crucial but communicating well as a data scientist is just as important,” he explains. Mr Syed recently completed an internship as a software developer and will be exploring his options in data science and research. His advice to new undergraduates is this: “Take your time to explore your interests, then just choose a starting point in terms of what your goals are. It’s not possible to know until you try it out.” Source: The Straits Times | Scholars' Choice © SPH Media Limited. Permission required for reproduction.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Find the space to innovate Experiencing the heady rush of being a tech pioneer is final-year Mechanical Engineering student Koh Ley How, who is working on the latest iteration of Nanyang Venture 11, an electric car with a design inspired by a killer whale that has already won an award at Shell’s annual eco-car competition for students around the world. “My main task is to improve on the existing design of the gear train and also redesign its components to make it sturdier. As the official test driver, I take the vehicle out on drives and give feedback on how else it can be improved,” says Ley How. He follows in the footsteps of his seniors, who worked on previous models of Nanyang Venture. The Nanyang Venture 8, Singapore’s first 3D-printed urban battery electric car, dominated headlines when it won six awards at the Shell competition in 2016, turning in Singapore’s best performance. Smitten by the allure of innovation in motorsports from a young age, Ley How is keen to help push the automotive industry to greener heights. “Being able to take part in the Shell Eco-marathon is ideal for engineers-to-be who want to break new ground. NTU has a strong track record of winning at this competition, where innovation is key. That’s my motivation to keep working on the car. I’m keen to continue along this path in the future,” he says. Opportunities to design and build are plentiful on the NTU Smart Campus, where innovation is encouraged and supported. A student start-up was recently in the news for developing FoodBots – self-driving food delivery robots. These four-wheelers have delivered over 6,000 food orders across the NTU campus.  “The FoodBot is an engineering dream for us. Almost every part of the robot is made by us, from 3D-printed parts to self-designed custom printed circuit boards,” says Melvin Foo, founder and third-year Renaissance Engineering Programme student.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/find-the-space-to-innovate'}, IndexData{title='Beyond education, into leadership | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student The Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE) provides tuition grant (TG) which covers a substantial portion of the full tuition fees to eligible students. Students who receive the tuition grant are required to pay only the subsidized tuition fee. Full-time undergraduate students who gain  admission to NTU  on a subsidised fee basi​s are eligible for Tuition Grant and GST subsidy from MOE up to the normal duration taken to complete a degree programme. This is usually three or four years, depending on the programme. For students who transfer or are re-admitted within NTU or across local universities, they will be eligible for Tuition Grant up to the normal programme duration less the number of semesters of Tuition Grant received for the previous programme(s). For example, if a student had spent 2 semesters in a local university, and transfers to NTU to pursue a 4-year (i.e. 8-semester)  undergraduate programme , the student will be eligible for the MOE Tuition Grant for only 6 (i.e. 8 minus 2) semesters at NTU. Singapore Citizens Singaporean students do not need to submit an application for MOE Tuition Grant and will automatically receive a Tuition Grant, if they have not already availed the maximum Tuition Grant in another bachelor degree or higher degree in a local university.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Double major Provided by The Double Major Programme is a four-year direct honours degree programme. Undergraduate students will read two majors chosen from among the disciplinary strengths of the four schools in the College, namely, the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), the School of Humanities (SoH), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). Unlike the existing single discipline-based degrees, this degree will feature two distinct majors within an innovative new structure. As such this is a fully conceived double-disciplinary degree. Each major will have equal weightage. Students will be admitted into this Double Major degree programme at the point of entry to NTU, and declare their two majors at this point. During this four-year degree programme, undergraduates will read both philosophy and history, benefiting from the expertise and resources of both programmes. The Philosophy curriculum allows students to explore, in a rigorous, systematic, and critical manner, fundamental problems about the nature of knowledge, reality, existence, mind, language, science, and morality. The curriculum includes a solid foundation in both eastern and western traditions of philosophy, and prepares students for the application of philosophy to the challenges of modern society. The History Programme seeks to train students to not only think critically but also to apply interdisciplinary methods to identify and address contemporary problems from historical perspectives. History graduates will master the secondary literature in their chosen areas of study, engage in independent research, exercise critical judgment about the texts that they encounter, and communicate their findings in a well-reasoned and scholarly manner.  4-Year Direct Honours Programme   Equal Weightage   Degree Scroll   Flexible You may apply to change your programme after your first year.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Sandra Davie Senior Education Correspondent As part of a series on university education, The Straits Times responds to a question on engineering degrees. Q: My father is an engineer and so is my maternal grandfather. I have been inspired by them to study engineering as well, at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) or National University of Singapore. But my friends say that with my grades, I can aim for something more competitive and exciting. Some of them feel that engineering is a boring subject and such a degree does not really offer many career options. What is your advice? A: It is good that you feel inspired by your father and grandfather to take up an engineering degree. What engineers do is indeed exciting and inspirational. What makes engineering interesting is that it covers a wide range of disciplines - from rockets to mobile phones to hip and knee replacements. At the heart of it, an engineer is a problem solver. Engineers use their knowledge to provide solutions to complex problems. I asked NTU's dean of engineering, Professor Louis Phee, what he tells young people seeking his advice on engineering. NTU's engineering education has been ranked highly in some league tables. Engineering and technology, as a broad subject area, has been ranked fourth best in the world by London-based education consultancy QS, for instance. Prof Phee, who is also the university's vice-president of innovation and entrepreneurship, said if you are the type to wonder why golf balls have dimples on them or why split-level houses experience more damage in earthquakes, then engineering may be the right choice for you. It can help you answer questions and push you to ask new questions and find new solutions. Learning to think like an engineer is another good reason to enter the field, he said. "Your entire thought process changes. You acquire logical thinking and critical analytical skills. Decision-making skills are improved. You become more objective and less emotional when it comes to work. "All of these skills are greatly needed in the professional world, in any field. So, engineers tend to do better no matter which sector they choose, and they also tend to make good managers. So much so, engineering is the most common undergraduate degree among Fortune 500 chief executives." At the core, engineers are problem solvers - and students completing an engineering degree would have acquired the skills and confidence to deal with any kind of problem, even beyond working life, he said. "You will know exactly how to go about it and where to hit it. No problem - no matter how big - will seem insurmountable. In fact, you will start viewing every problem as a challenge and an opportunity to grow. "It is also an education for the present and the future, where we are faced with complex, global challenges, such as climate change. "Imagine a special coating that could one day turn every window into an energy generator while insulating homes from heat, or 'self-healing' concrete that allows cracks in buildings and roads to be fixed just by reacting with rain. "Such innovations would require one to harness a combination of civil, electrical, materials and chemical engineering approaches. In this sense, engineering is never boring but full of different challenges where different perspectives are required," Prof Phee said. Hence, engineering education around the world has become highly interdisciplinary in nature. At NTU, there are new pathways for experiential and collaborative learning, such as the Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core curriculum rolled out last year to expose students to disciplines beyond their field of study. For instance, with the growing importance of data analytics, all engineering students must take a course on data science and artificial intelligence. First-year engineering students in the upcoming academic year in August will be able to opt for a new second major in data analytics. NTU also places a strong emphasis on inculcating an entrepreneurial mindset. Since last year, it has offered a second major in entrepreneurship. Beyond the classroom, NTU offers a broad range of programmes that offer unique learning opportunities. For instance, its strong ties with the industry at large means engineering students get the opportunity to work with heavyweights such as Dyson, Alibaba and Rolls-Royce. Students also benefit from global education, cultural immersion and work-learn programmes at both local and overseas universities. Credit: Dyson NTU Studio Since you want a rigorous programme that will stretch you, you may want to consider NTU's Renaissance Engineering Programme, a four-and-a-half year, dual degree programme that provides  broad-based interdisciplinary engineering education  which integrates engineering, science, business, technology management and humanities. This programme takes in more than 40 academically bright students each year, and they will graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering Science and a Master of Science in Technology Management. Students on the programme are encouraged to view problems not in silo, but in totality, resulting in a distinctive breed of engineers with the ability to bridge the gap between science, engineering and business. These students also have the opportunity to spend the third year overseas at one of the renowned partner universities. Prof Phee said the demand for engineers is growing across a wide variety of industries. For one thing, the ambitious targets set under the recently announced Singapore Green Plan 2030 underlines the fact that more engineers will be needed. In the private sector, technology firm Dyson is set to grow its engineering team in Singapore by 50 per cent, and it is one in a long line of companies doing so. The recent banking scam also shows the importance of cyber-security engineers in the finance sector. Ms April Khong, a financial-crime risk analyst with FinTech Railsbank, studied information engineering and media at NTU. The 24-year-old said many of her peers went on to degree-related jobs such as in user interface design. But when Railsbank, where she had been an intern, offered her a permanent job, she asked if she could take up a new role as a financial-crime risk analyst. Ms Khong, who was involved in a few social service start-ups while studying at NTU, said: "Scams affecting elderly people really tug at my heartstrings and I want to do something about it. That's why I asked my employer if it would let me take on the position of financial-crime risk analyst." Although her job is not related to her degree studies, she emphasised that at the end of the day, her job is about analysing a problem, understanding it and solving it - which her engineering education prepared her for. "You often hear about how engineering prepares you for all kinds of jobs, in all kinds of industries. It's not just a marketing slogan. It's true." Source: Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Welcome to NTU's newest academic college, College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS). CCDS is formed by combining the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) with other related disciplines in NTU. This strategic initiative comes at an exciting time, as computing, data science and artificial intelligence (AI) reshape our world. The new College will draw on a diverse pool of talent from NTU’s various schools and colleges to seize new opportunities and address societal challenges brought about by AI. We aim to be a talent magnet attracting world-class AI and computing scholars to Singapore. Students will be groomed to become skilled professionals who will drive innovation and technological excellence in developing AI and high-tech solutions for industry and society. CCDS will catalyse interdisciplinary research and education relating to computing and data science. This reflects the pervasive impact of these two fields in virtually all academic domains. CCDS will also develop new and exciting interdisciplinary areas of scientific inquiry using AI, spearheaded by the AI-for-X Research Centre, and the Computing and Society Institute, which will be hosted by the new college. AI is becoming a general-purpose technology. CCDS will serve as a platform for effectively delivering industry-relevant degree programmes. Among the new academic offerings this year are the interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science in AI and Society degree programme, the Turing AI Scholars Programme, and a Minor in AI for all undergraduates. In the pipeline are more undergraduate and postgraduate offerings in AI and computing to uplift the digital capabilities of NTU graduates and the broader workforce. CCDS will accelerate the adoption of AI to personalise education in all academic disciplines at NTU. These initiatives are in line with Singapore’s refreshed national AI strategy to triple the AI talent pool, develop a trusted AI ecosystem, and use AI to drive innovation and economic growth.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student askST: How can my child improve his job prospects in a disruptive future? Local university aims to equip students for the future of work with interdisciplinary skills sets and overseas opportunities   Q: My son wants to study a specialised programme, but I worry that it's too niche. How can universities prepare students for the wider job market? A: In today’s rapidly evolving job landscape, graduates need to have diverse, flexible skill sets, and be able to effectively apply them, says Professor Ling San, deputy president and provost at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). A report by the World Economic Forum in May 2023 found that companies are increasingly prioritising cognitive and soft skills. Analytical thinking and creative thinking were the top skills of growing importance for workers in the next five years, ahead of digital literacy and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. To provide students with transferable skills and knowledge useful to all industries, NTU launched seven courses under the Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core (ICC) curriculum in 2021, Prof Ling says. The courses are mandatory for all undergraduates at the university, equipping them with: Key transferable skills such as communication and innovation. Knowledge of global trends and challenges, including in areas of sustainability and digitalisation. Even within specialised degrees, interdisciplinary knowledge remains important. Prof Ling explains: “While a specialised degree can open the door to a graduate’s dream job, interdisciplinary skills and knowledge can broaden their horizons and enable them to excel beyond their field.” NTU is launching five new interdisciplinary undergraduate programmes this year. “These new programmes straddle multiple disciplines in traditional and emerging fields, giving students the chance to seize opportunities in a range of existing and upcoming industries.” One example is the Bachelor of Applied Computing in Finance offered jointly by Nanyang Business School and NTU’s newest academic college, the College of Computing and Data Science. The new degree programme aims to equip students with deep domain knowledge in finance and strong technological and analytical skill sets. Meanwhile, students in the new Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) programme – a four-year honours degree – will learn to integrate multiple disciplinary approaches in the study of society, politics, the economy, and ethics. They can choose to specialise in two or three disciplines. During their fourth year, students have to complete an interdisciplinary final-year project under the guidance of co-supervisors from different departments. The curriculum for NTU’s Bachelor of Chinese Medicine has also been refreshed in line with Singapore’s evolving healthcare needs, to focus on clinical cases, the ageing population and preventive care. The bilingual four-year degree programme is accredited by the Ministry of Health’s Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board. It will feature two new learning methods:  Technology-enabled learning using virtual and augmented reality. Team-based learning where students acquire knowledge on topics through peer interactions. While a specialised degree can open the door to a graduate's dream job, interdisciplinary skills and knowledge can broaden their horizons and enable them to excel beyond their field. - PROFESSOR LING SAN, deputy president and provost at Nanyang Technological University Q: What do job prospects look like for university graduates and how can my child improve his employability? A: The job market is expected to remain highly competitive, with rapid technological advancements such as AI poised to transform entire industries, says Prof Ling. In an advanced economy like Singapore, AI will affect about 60 per cent of jobs, replacing some and complementing others, according to a report published by the International Monetary Fund in January. But at the same time, “new jobs are being created in emerging industries, including AI, sustainability and blockchain”, Prof Ling adds. “NTU’s undergraduate programmes prepare students for employment opportunities in both existing and emerging fields.” For example, the new Accountancy for Future Leaders – Bachelor of Accountancy (Sustainability Management and Analytics) degree, offered by Nanyang Business School, weaves together two key emerging areas in the future economy – sustainability management and analytics. The four-year degree programme provides students with an accelerated pathway to attaining chartered accountant status with exemptions for the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification. The programme also offers students a minimum 30-week accountancy-related internship at training organisations accredited by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. The internship contributes to the mandatory three-year practical experience required for qualification as a chartered accountant. Meanwhile, NTU’s newly launched Turing AI Scholars Programme allows students in the Computer Science, Data Science, AI, or AI and Society courses to spend a year overseas studying and working at select institutions in academia and industry. Scholars in the programme can also look forward to one-on-one mentoring from AI specialists, and conducting research under the guidance of distinguished AI professors. NTU’s new undergraduate programmes are designed to prepare students for employment opportunities in both existing and emerging fields, says Professor Ling San, the university's deputy president and provost. PHOTO: NTU Q: My daughter is keen to work abroad in the future. How can her university experience help her secure a job opportunity overseas? A: It would be useful for her to gain overseas experience during her university years through overseas work attachments, study missions or exchange programmes, Prof Ling advises. This can provide her with “an expansive international outlook that prepares her for global citizenship”. At NTU, undergraduates can pursue overseas programmes and activities in over 60 countries. These include overseas internships and entrepreneurship initiatives to help them widen their perspective of the working world and enhance their career prospects. Such overseas experiences also enable students to build cultural empathy, understand global issues, manage cultural differences and acquire cultural intelligence, Prof Ling adds. Some courses offered by NTU also have overseas components built into the curriculum. For example, students in the new Accountancy for Future Leaders – Bachelor of Accountancy (Sustainability Management and Analytics) programme can go on an overseas study mission to investigate sustainability-related issues. Undergraduates in the PPE programme can translate theory into practice through a compulsory internship overseas or locally.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Course Provider Introduction The FlexiMasters in Marketing in a Digital World is designed to help marketers succeed in this digital age. To do well as a marketer, you need to know how to tell a good brand story, the tools (digital and non-digital) available at your disposal and how to use data to inform your decision. The program will equip you with the fundamental marketing knowledge and important analytic and digital marketing skills to meet industry demands in this age of complexity. So if you are currently a marketer who would like to refresh your knowledge or someone who would like to switch to a marketing role, this is the program for you. FlexiMasters in Marketing in a Digital World is offered at Nanyang Business School as part of the FlexiMasters series launched by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore). Credits earned can be stacked towards postgraduate degrees at NBS. Value Creation Through Effective Marketing The first part of module will examine the fundamentals of marketing. The coverage of the fundamentals will allow professionals new to marketing to understand the discipline better. For seasoned marketers, it is a refresher on the fundamentals of effective marketing. In the second part of the module, participants will be exposed to current ideas (e.g., customer experience, digital transformation) relevant to the marketing discipline. After this course, participants will understand the role of marketing in driving value creation in any organisation. This module will also set the basics for the next 4 modules in this FlexiMasters. Uncovering Consumer Insights In today’s rapidly-changing business environment, understanding consumer insights is crucial for marketers to stay ahead of their game. This course will introduce participants to consumer behavior concepts and frameworks that help marketers build a deep understanding of their target consumers; this in turn enables them to distill useful consumer insights for business decision-making.  After completing this course, you will understand the psychology of how consumers make decisions (i.e., how consumers think, feel, and choose between different alternatives such as brands, products, or services). You will also understand the influence of social and cultural environments (e.g., friends, family, and culture) on consumption patterns, and how marketers can adapt or improve their campaigns/strategies to more effectively reach and influence the consumers.  Social Media Listening and Analytics How can companies effectively leverage their social media engagement to achieve their marketing objectives? Social media listening enables companies to build timely consumer insights by using analytic tools to tap into different big social data. This social media listening course provides digital marketers with awareness of social media listening, knowledge of different analytic tools for Big Data from social interactions, as well as, experience of developing insights from their social media activities. Additionally, this course equips participants with the knowledge and skills to investigate existing business operational data to continually develop innovative marketing insights and new solutions for marketing decisions. Students will be exposed to various data modeling techniques using real-life business data that will allow them to provide useful predictions such as pricing, consumer trend analysis, and the likes. This course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from exploring the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results, especially in the context of social media. Omnichannel Communication Consumers today are bombarded with many unwanted messages daily. As a result, consumers have become more skeptical, more fragmented and more difficult to reach than before. To effectively engage consumers, it is increasingly important for companies to develop an omnichannel communication strategy. Omnichannel communication requires marketers to focus on developing an integrated marketing communication plan to reach consumers on all channels effectively and efficiently. To engage customers, companies take into account the platforms and devices their customers use. Information and insights developed are used to develop an integrated omnichannel customer experience by aligning the companies' objectives, design, and messages across all utilised channels. In this course, students will learn about crafting effective messages and making efficient use of different channels (both traditional and digital channels). By the end of this course, students should not only be familiar with a large body of marketing communication knowledge but should also be able to apply this information to create effective omnichannel communication strategies.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Driving new technologies In a video that has been viewed over 148,000 times on TikTok, a food delivery rider humorously challenges an adorable blue box on wheels to a fight for encroaching on his territory. That blue box is the FoodBot. It is part of a fleet of self-driving food delivery robots developed by Renaissance Engineering Programme student Melvin Foo and his team at Whizz Mobility. Since June 2020, the FoodBots have chalked up over 12,000 deliveries to hungry students on campus and others at the nearby CleanTech Park, an impressive feat for the five robots that were built from scratch in NTU. “Most of the parts are 3D-printed and assembled on campus, and 80% of the technology, from algorithms to fleet management software, was developed by NTU undergrads in the maker labs provided to us right beneath our hall rooms,” says Melvin. The founder of Whizz Mobility has always been a whiz kid. At nine, he began tinkering with technology. By the time he was 18, he had made smartphone apps, remote-controlled airplanes, smart security cameras and Internet of Things devices. When he couldn’t find the necessary parts for a robot he was planning to make, he built his own 3D printer to make them, using recycled factory discards and after countless hours of online research.    That love of innovation led Melvin to join NTU’s premier engineering programme, as he was keen to flex his inventive muscles whilst getting a world-class education. Graduating with a Master of Science in Technology Management is a bonus, he adds. “Apart from the many engineering disciplines this programme offers, I liked that we could go abroad for a year. I wanted to visit and learn from tech hubs overseas and bring that knowledge back home. In addition, I was keen to take business modules as I wanted to run my own business.”  The serial inventor went from strength to strength in his first two years as an undergrad, buoyed by his work on the Nanyang Venture XI, which competed in the Shell Eco-Marathon, an annual competition that challenges global student teams to design, build and drive ultra energy-efficient vehicles. “Working as part of an interdisciplinary and talented team of NTU students was an amazing experience. We all handled different aspects of the car, which became a source of pride and joy for us when everything came together in the end,” recalls Melvin.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/driving-new-technologies'}, IndexData{title='Embracing the Future: The Transformative Power of AI | Alumni | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Nurture Researchers of Tomorrow 1 2 3 Nurture Researchers of Tomorrow Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus Nurture Researchers of Tomorrow About URECA URECA acronym of Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus, is a university wide undergraduate research programme established in 2004 to cultivate a research culture and nurture research capabilities early in undergraduates’ university education. In this programme undergraduates will gain invaluable hands-on research experience under the mentorship of faculty of their choice in their chosen field of research over a period of 11 months (August to June). The foundations of research experience and practical skills gained through URECA prepares undergraduates for postgraduate research studies or career in research.  Upon successful completion of URECA, undergraduates will receive Academic Credits to fulfil unrestricted electives course, which is part of the NTU General Education Requirement curriculum. In addition, undergraduates will be awarded the URECA certificate of achievement with coveted title of NTU President Research Scholar. Students’ Experiences Students’ Testimonials Michelle Neoh Jin Yee from SSS, Journey from URECA to Postgraduate Research ‘I was in the URECA programme in Year 2 and took up the FYP-URECA in Year 4. I am currently in the PhD (Psychology) programme at NTU. Joining the URECA programme gave me the opportunity to gain first-hand and hands-on experience of the research process and was an important stepping stone to my FYP-URECA.' Chong Sin Yi from SCBE, IDR-URECA Project ‘As an interdisciplinary research project, IDR-URECA allowed me to explore my interests in molecular biology and nanotechnology. This project met my expectation as it equipped me with theoretical knowledge and practical skills in two disciplines. I also gained insight into the research workplace, which would allow me to have an edge over others in a future research career.' Lee Ming Yang from ASE, URECA Project ‘I participated in URECA twice and had two vastly different experiences. Looking back, I can say that while every URECA project is a unique experience in itself, all of them have given me valuable insight into the research process and whether research is the right path for me.' Lim Wu Cong from EEE, FYP-URECA Project 'URECA brings the word “research” closer to undergraduate students like you and me, and widens our horizon. Participating in URECA and FYP-URECA not only expanded the “width” of my knowledge, but also the “depth”.'

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Capitalising on the rush of running When COVID-19 hit, virtual running events exploded in popularity as people sought safe ways to exercise during the lockdown period. The audience for virtual runs is also very large since participants can run wherever they are based. Zhou Mi (NBS/2013), the co-founder of 42Technology which developed 42Race, a fitness social platform, caught the emerging trend, and today, her company is one of the frontrunners in online fitness solutions in Southeast Asia. The talented businesswoman did not set out to own a company when she was a business undergraduate at NTU. Her first ambition was to become an accountant. Zhou Mi is the co-founder of 42Technology, the developer behind fitness app 42Race. She first encountered entrepreneurship when she signed up for the Minor in Entrepreneurship programme during the summer break after Year 1. As part of the programme, she was offered to set up a pushcart business at NTU South Spine at a very affordable rental rate. She continued, “My business model was very simple. I procured stationery with cute designs from overseas and sold them at a profit. I earned about S$80,000 in just one year. That experience opened my eyes to the opportunities of entrepreneurship and made me believe that I can be successful at it.” Zhou Mi’s first business venture: selling stationery at South Spine in 2010. Yet Zhou Mi did not pursue her newfound passion. After graduating with a double degree in Accountancy and Marketing from Nanyang Business School in 2013, she joined Procter & Gamble as a marketer. In late 2014, the avid runner completed a 250km ultra-marathon in Madagascar and raised funds for NTU student bursaries. Zhou Mi (left) and fellow NTU alumnus, Lim Zhen Long (CCEB/2013) whom she befriended at Procter & Gamble, after completing the 250km ultra-marathon in Madagascar in 2014. That sense of achievement gave her a morale boost and the confidence to quit her job and launch her entrepreneurial dream. With her co-founder, Augustine Chua, whom she had met during an inter-university programme, she set up an Internet-based business providing travel packages for running enthusiasts participating in global marathons. Before that, they participated in various hackathons and won a S$10,000 cash prize. They also raised S$500,000 in seed funding from investors. However, while their business idea was good, the business growth was not good enough. The bubbly 34-year-old said: “In 2016, we decided to pivot from travel planning to virtual running. Virtual runs were a fairly new concept back then and we were the first such start-up in Singapore. Our company provides a branding platform for brands and a dashboard for runners to record their timing and update their social feeds to show how they are enjoying the run experience. Our big break came when we organised a major virtual run with Reebok in 2018, which attracted over 7,000 participants across Southeast Asia - setting our company’s record.” The company name was inspired by the sci-fi novel, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. According to the book, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42. During the pandemic, her company delivered more than 400 online running projects through partnerships with companies including AIA and Great Eastern, and about 50 fundraising virtual runs for charitable organisations. For example, the virtual SAFRA Run and Army Marathon saw even higher participation rates with over 30,000 runners. Nevertheless, like most businesses, 42Race was also impacted by the pandemic. Zhou Mi explained, “The logistics chain was affected. At one point, we couldn’t provide medals for our runs. We also had to quickly come up with solutions and developed new products to keep our business going. We sold our software to companies that needed an employee engagement system for health and wellness tracking. We also introduced 42Class, a virtual gym system with curated fitness videos, user-generated content and customisation features.”  Zhou Mi (sitting, first from right) leads a team of about 20 people at 42Technology. Zhou Mi is proud that the platform has now served over 600,000 users. She attributes her success to three groups of people: supportive investors who believed in their unconventional business, her well-connected NTU alumni friends who gave her good advice, and the brand partners who provided them with golden opportunities. One of the many lessons she has learnt as an entrepreneur is to stay resilient and be adaptable, especially in the ever-changing and fast-moving Internet business landscape. She advises budding entrepreneurs to “make a lot of friends and build safety nets because there will be a lot of risks”. Additionally, she says that it is important to identify the issues faced by your target consumers, before thinking of providing them with solutions. “For the fitness industry, it is not so much about new equipment or more services. The hurdle is that people lack the motivation to keep fit, so this is the value that we try to deliver through our products. We are currently working on a new app called Tiny Pets, where we will use gamification to motivate people to be happier and healthier through exercise.”   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/capitalising-on-the-rush-of-running'}, IndexData{title='Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Double Major - Chinese and Linguistics and Multilingual Studies | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Double major Provided by The Double Major Programme is a four-year direct honours degree programme. Undergraduate students will read two majors chosen from among the disciplinary strengths of the four schools in the College, namely, the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), the School of Humanities (SoH), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). Unlike the existing single discipline-based degrees, this degree will feature two distinct majors within an innovative new structure. As such this is a fully conceived double-disciplinary degree. Students will be admitted into this Double Major degree programme at the point of entry to NTU, and declare their two majors at this point. During this four-year degree programme, undergraduates will read both their majors in both Psychology and Media Analytics, benefiting from the expertise and resources of both the School of Social Sciences(SSS) and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information(WKWSCI). The Psychology and Media Analytics curriculum is for students who strive to understand how our minds process media messages. In addition to a broad introduction to psychology, students develop expertise in the research methods that organisations use to track the effectiveness of messages delivered through social and traditional media. They learn how to identify characteristics of messages that are more effective than others. Other NTU programmes are better suited for students who wish to develop their skills in areas like writing and making images, but this curriculum is for the student who wants to learn cutting-edge methods for analyzing using it strategically.

The Coat of Arms comprises of a heraldic shield divided into two sections: the lower portion shows a stalking lion facing the spectator on a white background and the upper portion two atomic symbols, one on either side of a cog-wheel above a battlement on a red background - the same colour as used in the national flag of Singapore.   The battlement symbolises the School of Civil and Structural Engineering while the atomic symbols refer to the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The cog-wheel represents the School of Mechanical and Production Engineeringand is also a traditional reference to engineering and technology in general. These three were the original Schools set up with the founding of the Nanyang Technological Institute, the predecessor institution of NTU.

Text: Samantha Lim Jing Hui (left) meeting Mr Chen (middle) for the first time and presenting him with a thank-you card. Tan Jing Hui’s love for reading began at a bookstore in Jalan Besar. She would visit with her parents every month, losing herself in Chinese books for children. Ten years later, that same bookstore is helping Jing Hui pursue her Chinese literature studies at NTU’s School of Humanities. Currently a Year 3 student, Jing Hui received the Shanghai Book Company Scholarship last year, which allowed her to reduce the time spent working part-time and concentrate on her schoolwork as well as her leadership duties with the Welfare Services Club. The scholarship enabled Jing Hui to wholeheartedly pursue her role as Overseas Volunteering Expedition Chairperson for the Welfare Services Club in the last academic year. Building on a family legacy Established in the 1920s, the Shanghai Book Company was recognised as a key player in shaping Singapore’s early Chinese literary and cultural scene. The bookstore brought new books and exciting ideas from Shanghai and quickly found success in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. In 2008, when its main shareholders – Mr Chen Mong Tse (Science/1959), his wife Mdm Chai Chu Chun (Arts/1959), and his sister Ms Chen Mong Sing (Arts/1959) – decided to close the family business, the three of them unanimously decided to donate S$1 million from the proceeds to NTU. Their donation formed a variety of bursaries and scholarships, allowing the Chens to support students at different stages of their academic journey. For example, one of the scholarships – the Mdms Chen Mong Hock, Linda, & Chen Mong Sing Scholarship – has a freshman and graduate version. The freshman scholarship goes to academically gifted students just starting out in the Chinese programme, while the graduate scholarship is awarded to students to encourage them to pursue Chinese studies at a higher level. “The Shanghai Book Company received such great support from the Chinese communities in these regions,” Mr Chen shares. “When we sold the company, we wanted to pour the proceeds into educating the children of these communities.” “As graduates of the Nanyang University, NTU’s predecessor institution, my family has always had a deep connection with the University. Naturally, we decided to use our gift to support the Chinese programme.” Passing on the gift of education For Mr Goh Soon Hong (NBS/1995), his reason for setting up a scholarship ran to one word: gratitude. “Back in my time, you were considered extremely fortunate if you could go to university,” Mr Goh reminisces. “I benefited so much from having a good education, and I wanted to offer someone that same opportunity as well.” A banking veteran with over 25 years of experience, Mr Goh became a new donor to NTU this year. He created the Yu En (育恩) Scholarship, which translated, means “gratitude for one’s education”. The scholarship, which prioritises talented but financially disadvantaged students in its selection process, provides a business undergraduate with S$10,000 annually across a period of four academic years. Mr Goh chose to support his Nanyang Business School (NBS) juniors, crediting the School for its role in his achievements today. “Back then, many of my friends were going to another local university to study business administration. But I chose NTU, because it had everything I wanted. It allowed me to specialise early in banking and find my path. It’s also where I made lifelong friendships with my batchmates, and NBS seniors and juniors. Till today, many of us work alongside each other in the banking industry, and those relationships started at NTU.” “It can be challenging to juggle both school and part-time work, just to fund your education,” Mr Goh shares. “Through the scholarship, I want to relieve my beneficiaries of their financial worries, so that they can focus on learning as much as they can.” Bonds forged through giving Both the Chens and Mr Goh see their gifts as more than just a donation – as a doorway to new relationships with the next generation. Mr Chen makes it a point to meet up with Shanghai Book Company scholarship students every year. He and Jing Hui met for the first time in July. “I was quite nervous at first,” Jing Hui confessed. “But Mr Chen was so warm and friendly. You could see that he was genuinely interested in each of us – he asked us about our families and why we chose Chinese studies.” “I also had the opportunity to thank him for the scholarship. It really helped me a lot last year, as I was juggling schoolwork, leadership duties in the NTU Welfare Services Club, and giving part-time tuition. With the scholarship, I could cut back on my part-time work and focus on growing as a leader and a person.” “I enjoy meeting and getting to know the students,” Mr Chen shares. “As I do so, I’m comforted to see how the legacy of the Shanghai Book Company lives on, and will continue to strengthen Chinese communities for a very long time.” Mr Chen with the Shanghai Book Company scholarship and bursary beneficiaries at a meet-up in July this year. Likewise, Mr Goh hopes to serve as a personal mentor to his scholarship recipients. “At NBS, our lecturers and tutors were business practitioners themselves. They would share real-life experiences and insights, which better prepared me to take on the industry.” “Now that I’ve been working in banking for a good number of years, I hope to do the same for the students,” Mr Goh says. “It’s always more meaningful if my experiences can be used to benefit someone and help them go further in life.” Creating a named bursary or scholarship is a great way to support needy students. Bursaries and scholarships are typically named in honour of donors or individuals that the donors wish to commemorate. Donors can specify the school or group of talent they would like to support. For an endowed bursary or scholarship, similar to those set up by Mr Chen’s family, the principal sum contributed is invested for the long term, generating perpetual returns. The financial assistance disbursed to students comes from the income generated by the bursary's investments. To establish an endowed bursary or scholarship, a minimum sum of S$150,000 is required. A term bursary or scholarship, such as Mr Goh’s, uses the donated sum until the funds are depleted. The minimum amount needed to establish a term bursary or scholarship ranges between S$40,000 and S$50,000.   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/gifts-that-connect-the-generations'}, IndexData{title='FlexiMasters in Business and Financial Analytics | Nanyang Business School | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Certification FlexiMasters Introduction The FlexiMasters in Business Finance is suitable for participants interested in finance but who had a minimal exposure to this field at the tertiary level.  A sequence of five graduate courses will give participants a broad exposure to financial topics including financial management (corporate finance), Investments, and newer topics such as fintech and sustainable finance. FlexiMasters in Business Finance is offered at Nanyang Business School as part of the FlexiMasters series launched by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore). Credits earned can be stacked towards postgraduate degrees at NBS. Financial Management The objective of this course is to provide a broad understanding of key financial principles, concepts, and analytical tools. The topics to be covered include the time value of money, bond and stock valuation, capital budgeting, risk and return, cost of capital, corporate financial decisions (capital structure, dividend distribution policy and capital raising), and an introduction to options. It is a necessary first foundation course in finance. Financial Statement Analysis The course aims to equip students with accounting skills and knowledge essential for understanding and analysing financial statements for business decisions. Students will learn the concepts and applications of financial accounting standards on key economic transactions of the reporting entity so that they can interpret and analyse financial statements. These transactions include complex scenarios that involve financial instruments, impairment, leases, and income taxes. Investments This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamentals of modern finance and their applications to business challenges in investment. Models of investment are at the heart of every investment decision, whether that decision is to buy, sell, or hold. Due to the globalization process and ever-changing dynamics of the modern financial markets, the pricing of any financial asset has become a more complex task. This course will guide students through the theory and application of several main topics of investment and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each valuation model. Students will learn valuation, portfolio construction and evaluation techniques, and apply investment techniques using EXCEL. The main topics are: (A) an introduction to asset classes and financial instruments, and how to trade financial securities; (B) risk and return, capital allocation decisions; (C) Modern portfolio theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and Multi-factor models; (D) performance evaluation of mutual funds and other portfolios. International Economics and Finance This course is an introduction to international economics and finance. It serves to introduce decision-makers in the managerial and business profession to modern economic and financial theories and models. These theories and models shed light on economic issues that impinge on the performance of business and industrial enterprises that operate in a competitive international setting. Many companies engage in cross-border business and they face important financial questions beyond those found in a purely domestic setting. This course endeavours to provide the basic understanding and tools to analyse, evaluate, finance, and manage international business. The issues and tools discuss are particularly relevant to highly open economies, such as Singapore, where companies will engage in international business. In this course, we will describe the global financial markets that facilitate international business and explain the key economic linkages among them. In the context of international finance, understanding foreign exchange rates is crucial. We will therefore explain exchange rates and those factors that affect the rates. We will then examine the challenges for companies created by unexpected changes in exchange rates. We will also discuss how these firms should manage their exposure to currency fluctuations. Lastly, we will explore areas of international corporate finance like capital budgeting and financing from the perspective of multinational companies. Students who attend this course will be prepared for rewarding careers providing advice, analysis, creative insights and solutions in economics, finance and business. They may work as an economist, business analyst/consultant, financial/risk analyst, or policy development officer; or they may choose to pursue graduate studies in economics, business, or professional designation in finance (e.g. CFA) or accounting (e.g. CPA). Contemporary Finance: Fintech and Sustainable Finance In recent years, the development of Fintech, especially the application of blockchain and AI in finance, has attracted tremendous attention from both industry and academia. Fintech is considered as the core competitiveness by financial institutions. This course will not only cover the basic knowledge, but also teach skills of developing new applications. It lays the foundation for more advanced courses and helps students get prepared for a career in the FinTech industry. You will learn the basics of blockchain and AI technologies and related practical topics, such as CBDC, crypto economics, digital asset management. You will also learn how to use open-source Python packages to design, test, and implement algorithms in finance. Sustainable finance integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into business and investment decisions for sustainable outcomes, which include reducing inequality, improving inclusiveness, reducing pollution, and mitigating and adapting to the adverse effects of climate change, among others.     Singapore Citizens (aged 21-39) / PR (aged ≥21) 70% Funding $20,000.00 $6,540.00 $20,000.00 $2,540.00 $20,000.00 $2,540.00 ​NTU Alumni Fee payable after 70% SSG Funding and use of $1,600 **NTU Alumni Course Credits $20,000.00 $6,016.80 1. Under the SkillsFuture Mid-career Enhanced Subsidy (MCES) scheme.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student This programme aims at equipping participants with skills necessary to run modern enterprises. The five-course sequence will focus on key aspects of business strategy, people management, operations, company governance, cultural intelligence and business negotiation.  FlexiMasters in General Management is offered at Nanyang Business School as part of the FlexiMasters series launched by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore). Credits earned can be stacked towards postgraduate degrees at NBS. Strategic Management Gain insights into the practice of strategy formulation in their relevant contexts by studying cases of how organizations have deployed their capabilities to achieve strategic outcomes in their business(es). Participants will understand and apply the concepts, principles and frameworks for formulating strategy. Participants will also learn how strategic capabilities may be developed and deepened in their organization so that they may more effectively achieve strategic outcomes for their organization. People Management The global economy presents many opportunities and challenges for businesses and their leaders. Managers need to develop a repertoire of people management capabilities to remain effective. This course aims giving participants both theoretical and practical understanding of what is required to lead people in organizations, be it in your own country of origin, in a different country, or leading across many countries or cultures (where people may be similar or quite different to you in different respects). You will realise the importance of developing interpersonal relationships and building social networks, gaining better self-awareness when working within teams and alongside ‘machines’. It will also prepare you to lead yourself and teams authentically in a VUCA workplace within a world with ‘less work’. You will gain insights about your own leadership competencies and will get a chance to further develop many of them, acquiring a systems perspective of your role as a leader in advancing the good in the workplace and society. You will also gain a deeper understanding of organizations’ perspective on Talent Management and how firms use strategic HR processes to ensure the execution of business strategies.  Operations The operations function in an organisation is responsible for the design, control, and improvement of systems concerned with the production and delivery of goods and services. As operations account for a significant portion of the value add and cost in any business, even a small advantage in operations can mean the difference between winning and losing in a competitive marketplace. In this course, we will demonstrate that operations management can serve two purposes: (1) to support corporate strategy, and (2) to inspire business model innovation. To succeed in either of these two endeavours, this course will introduce the fundamental concepts, best practices, and key challenges/issues in managing business operations. The course will use a mix of case studies, readings, exercises, and lectures to convey the course content. This course is particularly relevant if you are interested in a consulting career or have entrepreneurial inclinations. If you are interested in other business functions such as finance or marketing, you may appreciate the material in this course as it provides a better perspective on the overall workings of a business organisation. Business Ethics & Corporate Governance Business Ethics & Corporate Governance (BE&CG) will stimulate the mindset of managers and leaders to balance the key, often conflicting priorities faced in leadership, business, government, family owned businesses and in the not-for-profit work environment. The aim is to develop strategies to make difficult, but crucial organisational decisions considering the dynamic external environment. BE&CG provides insights into what it takes to develop and/or strengthen an effective governance structure to enable the organisation to meet increasingly challenging goals aligned with different stakeholders’ sometimes conflicting needs. We will discuss pertinent and topical issues to provoke you to think about what accountability and responsible risk-taking really mean and foster an understanding of incorporating and embedding ethical practices in your strategy. We will cover Ethical Leadership; Corporate Social Responsibility (Human Rights, Labour and the Environment); Anti-Bribery & Corruption and Corporate Governance. Cultural Intelligence & Business Negotiation The global economy presents many opportunities and challenges for businesses and their leaders. Senior executives need to develop a repertoire of strategic leadership capabilities to remain effective and manage stakeholders. One of the most important capabilities needed is cultural intelligence (CQ) – the ability to function effectively across a variety of cultural contexts. This course will equip participants with a working understanding of Cultural intelligence (CQ) and with a three-steps process (self-awareness, cultural mapping and style switching) that will enable them to work more effective across cultural boundaries globally and in Asia. Not many objectives in life can be achieved unilaterally. In order to get things done, we often need to obtain the agreement and cooperation of other people or organisations. Negotiation is essential not only in a professional or business context, but also in social and personal settings. Strong negotiation skills are therefore an important prerequisite for professional and personal success. You are a good negotiator if you can get what you want from your negotiating counterparts; you are an excellent negotiator if those negotiating counterparts are happy to deal with you again. Good negotiation skills can be innate; excellent negotiation skills require careful thought and attention to the process.     Singapore Citizens (aged 21-39) / PR (aged ≥21) 70% Funding $20,000.00 $6,540.00 $20,000.00 $2,540.00 $20,000.00 $2,540.00 NTU Alumni Fee payable after 70% SSG Funding and use of $1,600 **NTU Alumni Course Credits $20,000.00 $6,016.80 1. Under the SkillsFuture Mid-career Enhanced Subsidy (MCES) scheme.

A Major in LMS gives graduates insight into one of the most intriguing aspects of human knowledge and behaviour, and at the same time introduces them to related disciplines. As language is an integral part of all human activities, the study of linguistics provides a conducive platform for interdisciplinary discourse and research. The interdisciplinary nature of LMS ensures that students obtain a solid general education through being exposed to a variety of disciplines such as Sociology, Communication, Computer Science, Education, Hearing and Speech sciences, Law, Literature, Philosophy, and Psychology. The LMS programme in NTU complements courses in related areas and encourages students to think beyond their specific fields.   Students majoring in LMS at NTU may organise their studies around different aspects of the field or concentrations. For example, a student may decide to concentrate on how language is acquired and processed (Language Mind and Multilingualism concentration); how language relates to social and cultural forces (Multilingual Societies and Multiculturalism concentration), language learning and teaching (Applied English Linguistics concentration); how language is used in the ever changing and innovating technological world (Language and Technology concentration); or how language systems are analysed from a variety of theoretical perspectives (General Linguistics concentration). Students can also choose courses from two or more of these concentrations. All of these programmes share a common focus on the application of linguistic knowledge to practical issues related to languages in modern society.

For this reason we encourage all interested parties to apply.  A. Major Requirements  Total (AUs)  Duration of study  The curriculum is designed as a four-year course. Well-prepared students can complete the degree in three and a half years.  In May and June 2007, a market survey was carried out with 27 major employers both from the public and private sectors in Singapore, with advice from the NTU Career Attachment Office. These employers included the Ministry of Education, Singapore National Employers Federation, Singapore HR Institute, Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Mediacorp, Standard and Poor's, JP Morgan Chase, and Singapore Press Holdings. Of those who responded, an overwhelming majority (93% - 100%) find that graduates who understand the workings of different cultures and languages and who have a global worldview and international experience are valuable assets to their companies. Graduates with multidisciplinary analytical skills, such as graduates of the LMS programme, are certainly thought to be important by the potential employers. It was generally agreed that Linguistics and Multilingual Studies graduates, with their skill sets, are highly employable.  Since the first batch of graduates in 2012, LMS graduates have gone on to work in the following positions:  Analyst at the National Security Coordination Secretariat  Teacher/Education Policy Analyst under the Ministry of Education  Editor at World Scientific Publishing  Education Therapist at the Dyslexic Association of Singapore  Foreign service officer/Analyst at the Ministry of Home Affairs  Information officer at the Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts  Management Associate at the Singapore Tourism Board  Researcher at the University of Saarland, Germany  Sales Desk Researchers at Microsoft Singapore  Those who chose to further their studies are now pursuing/have been accepted to graduate school to pursue Linguistics at NTU and University of Colorado Boulder, US; Law at Singapore Management University and Cardozo School of Law, US; Speech Pathology at the National University of Singapore; and Education at the National Institute of Education, NTU.    The list below provides a general overview on possible career opportunities suited to LMS graduates.  Public relations: The maintenance of the flow of information between an organization and the general publics is a critical part involved in public relations. As our graduates are trained to think critically and analytically with awareness of different cultural and linguistic contexts, our graduates will make perfect candidates for the positions in public relations.  Marketing and advertising: As LMS graduates are trained to be sensitive to language and cultural nuances, they are sought after in the field of marketing and advertising. For example, companies that name products do extensive linguistic and cultural research on the associations that people make with particular sounds and classes of sounds. A background in LMS qualifies students for this line of work.   Work in the publishing industry, as a technical writer, or an editor: The verbal and cultural skills that LMS graduates develop are ideal for positions in editing, publishing, and writing.  Work in education:  People with a background in LMS and education develop curricula and materials, train teachers, and design tests and other methods of assessment, especially for language arts and second language learning.   Teach languages: Training in LMS provides a solid foundation for anyone who is contemplating a career in language teaching. It gives them fundamental training to make cross language comparison to arrive at solutions, a critical aspect in multilingual societies such as Singapore. A degree in LMS is an excellent entry point for a Postgraduate Diploma in Education.  Work in the computer industry: Linguists and Multilingual experts may work on speech recognition, search engines, and artificial intelligence. Their skills are also required in Internet start-up or e-commerce where expertise in how natural language processing can get systems to respond more meaningful to searches and requests.   Work as a translator or interpreter: Skilled translators and interpreters are needed everywhere, from government to hospitals to courts of law. For this line of work, a high level of proficiency in the relevant language(s) is necessary, and specialized training is required. LMS can help students understand the issues that arise when a message is communicated from one language to another.   Work on language documentation or do fieldwork: A number of projects and institutes around the world are looking for linguists and multilingual experts to work with language consultants to document, analyse, and preserve languages (many of which are endangered). Some organisations engage in language-related fieldwork, including documenting endangered languages, conducting language surveys, establishing literacy programmes, and translating documents of cultural heritage.   Work for a testing agency: LMS graduates can also help prepare and evaluate standardized exams and conduct research on assessment issues. They can be more attuned to problems which are specific to multilingual communities as tests are often designed for more monolingual populations.   Work with dictionaries (lexicography): Knowledge of phonology, morphology, historical linguistics, dialectology, and sociolinguistics is key to becoming a lexicographer.   Become a consultant on language in professions such as law or medicine: The subfield of forensic linguistics involves studying the language of legal texts, linguistic aspects of evidence, issues of voice identification, and so on. Law enforcement agencies and police departments, law firms, and the courts hire linguists for these purposes.  Speech therapist:  A linguistics degree is a good preparation for a graduate program in Speech pathology and communication disorders. Students get trained in both the fundamentals of language such as the system of speech sounds and grammar as well as in applied domains such as language disorders, language and the brain and sociolinguistics. Linguistics at NTU qualifies students for a professional degree program.  Related Programmes National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-arts-(hons)-in-linguistics-and-multilingual-studies'}, IndexData{title='Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Double Major - English and Philosophy | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Single Degree Provided by As an academic discipline, philosophy is concerned with the study of fundamental problems, such as those about the nature of knowledge, reality, existence, mind, language, science, and morality.  The Philosophy Group offers a range of programmes to students at NTU. Undergraduate tracks include the BA (Honours), second major and minor programmes in philosophy. Graduate tracks include the MA and PhD programmes in philosophy.                                                                                                                                              We also offer courses that can be taken as electives by NTU students outside our philosophy.

For this reason we encourage all interested parties to apply.  The curriculum is designed as a four-year programme. Well-prepared students can complete the degree in three and a half years. ​ ​Students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Philosophy are required to complete two categories of requirements, totalling at least 128 Academic Units (AUs):  ​ ​A. Major Requirements (69 AUs) ​ B. General Education Requirements (GER) (59 AUs).​ Click here to learn more about the programme structure.  The unique perspective that philosophy offers makes its students potentially fit for any profession.  Philosophy trains its students to question fundamental assumptions, argue logically, and think through issues as comprehensively as possible. In this way, philosophy shapes the way we think and act. It also heightens our sensitivity towards the nuances of life, and enhances our ability to engage with them. The study of philosophy typically cultivates the following abilities:  Ask good questions, think independently, critically, and clearly  Uncover and examine hidden assumptions  Analyse and critically assess arguments  Formulate consistent, coherent, and complex arguments  Conceptualise and articulate difficult issues or abstract ideas  Examine and justify what we believe in or/and what we do  These skills are extremely useful in a broad range of disciplines such as anthropology, biology, business administration, computer science, history, law, literature, media, physics, political science, psychology, religious studies, and sociology. Many philosophy students have benefited from concurrently pursuing another degree in the above disciplines.  Philosophical training equips students with transferable skills that enable them to adapt to changing circumstances of the world. Students of philosophy have successfully navigated in different career paths such as arts, business, computer science, law, medicine, public administration, publishing, writing, and many others.  For information on non-academic career paths for philosophy majors, see the following links taken from the American Philosophical Association:  News articles testify:  Related Programmes National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-arts-(hons)-in-philosophy'}, IndexData{title='Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Chinese | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student When he completes his double degree at Nanyang Technological University, final-year student Dhruval Kothari hopes to leverage his skills “to create meaningful and beneficial outcomes for others”. PHOTO: SPH MEDIA   Sourcing for his own lodging and learning how to live abroad by himself while coding to build a dashboard for a client in Michigan. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to counter bicycle theft. These are just some of the adventures Mr Dhruval Kothari has had. The 24-year-old is a final-year  Renaissance Engineering Programme (REP)  scholar at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), pursuing a bachelor’s offered by the College of Engineering and a master’s offered by Nanyang Business School. “The double degree allowed me to seamlessly blend my passion for engineering with the pursuit of a master’s degree,” shares Mr Kothari. Students in the REP obtain both degrees within four and a half years. One of the programme’s biggest draws is a year-long exchange with an overseas partner university. As a scholar, his living expenses in the United States were fully covered. He picked the University of California (UC), Berkeley which is known for its computer science programmes. There, he attended classes in computer security, AI deep learning and neural networks. “The professors in UC Berkeley are very established and well published,” says Mr Kothari. The REP scholar also benefited from the melting pot of nationalities and cultures at the university. “I met people from Japan, Indonesia, Canada and the US,” he recalls. “It was interesting to learn about how things work in different countries.” During his marketing module at UC Berkeley, he worked with other students to pitch a business idea almost every week. “We did not just learn the theory of technology but also its application in the business world,” he adds. While in the US, he also interned at Danlaw, a global leader in connected vehicle and automotive solutions. The company designs and develops technology for smarter vehicles, safer roads and more efficient cities. Danlaw collects vehicle, sensor and behavioural data to provide valuable insights into driver safety, efficient transportation, insurance and vehicle diagnostics. “With my team, I built a dashboard showing useful statistics about each car and pitched the dashboard to the management team,” says Mr Kothari. Because the firm was based in Michigan and required face-time with clients, Mr Kothari had to source for his own accommodation during his 10-week internship, learning to cook his own meals and do his own laundry.   Campus life at NTU He had his first real taste of independence when he entered university in 2020. The REP is a fully residential course where students are guaranteed a place in an NTU student dormitory. “Hall life in NTU was a great space for me to spend time and interact with my friends, use shared facilities and participate in various hall celebrations,” he adds.   “We did not just learn the theory of technology but also its application in the business world.”   “It was really fulfilling to witness the positive impact our project had,” he says. “This endeavour was completely in line with my goals and aspirations – to leverage my skills in technology to create meaningful and beneficial outcomes for others.” During a hackathon organised by the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX), Mr Kothari tapped AI and computer vision to build a bicycle recognition database. Cyclists can upload photos of their stolen bicycles and the program would automatically note the bicycle’s model and make as well as any scratches and colour differences.   Expanding his knowledge Since young, Mr Kothari has been interested in computers and technology. His father, who plans data centres in Asia-Pacific (APAC) for software giant Microsoft, often discusses the latest developments in the field with him. The father and son duo would watch YouTube videos on product demonstrations together. “My father never sent me for coding classes, but because of our shared interest, I picked up coding on my own,” he says. His engineering speciality at the REP is computer science, but he is also required to take compulsory modules in other engineering disciplines such as electrical, mechanical and biochemical engineering. This cross-domain approach has given him a solid foundation and understanding of the other engineering specialisations. There is also a wide variety of non-engineering subjects. In addition to marketing and entrepreneurship classes to nurture his interest in business, Mr Kothari also enrolled in courses in literature, ethics and law. “For example, we learnt about the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore,” he says. “This is useful when you work for a tech company and need to adhere to the PDPA regulations. It is also important that businesses not merely chase profits but also make ethical decisions.” Source: The Straits Times | Scholars' Choice © SPH Media Limited. Permission required for reproduction.

Would you like to delve into these courses and understand the skillsets you'll develop through them? Let our DC Super Seniors, comprised of both current students and alumni, share their experiences with you regarding some of these courses! Our graduates are highly sought after across a wide variety of careers in industries such as: Muhammad Sofian Bin Mohamed Tahir (Bachelor of Civil Engineering with a Second Major in Society & Urban Systems, Class of 2021) Project Engineer, Land Transport Authority (LTA) Singapore Rapid urbanisation presents opportunities and challenges to society. Civil engineers stand at the crossroads and dream of the possibilities that lie ahead. At NTU CEE, you get to build the foundations necessary to be part of this. Here, future engineers are developed to be adaptable and creative problem solvers. The academically rigorous curriculum has honed my engineering competencies while broadening my worldview. It separates the lab courses from the actual courses and hence gives more time to cover the content courses, instead of skimming trhrough it to cater for an integrated session within those courses. Through internships, research projects, global exposure, and personal development, I have had no shortage of avenues to learn outside the classroom. Most importantly, I take pride in the tightly knit community student have with faculty and staff. Civil Engineering has one of the highest post-graduation employment rates because of the nature of civil works that are rarely out of demand. This makes it very easy for graduates to find a job in the civil engineering sector. It is a relatively manageable programme, students will have time to pursue other CCAs. Thng Xiong Jie Terence (Bachelor of Civil Engineering, Class of 2020) Structural Engineer, DP Engineers Pte Ltd I am currently a Structural Engineer in DP Engineers Pte Ltd, an engineering consultancy firm. My role is to undertake structural analysis, calculations and prepare design sketches and drawings indicating the design intent for building projects. This includes ensuring that the design intent meet the relevant design codes, requirements, regulations, and client’s expectations.  My job also requires me to prepare the technical reports documenting the analysis and design results for authority submissions and subsequent correspondences. As a design consultant, I work with different stakeholders (e.g., architects, mechanical and electrical engineers, contractors, etc.) to ensure a well-coordinated, smooth and safe delivery of project to the client. My job is satisfying as I get to see my design turns into reality on the ground where people get to work, study and live in. It is a rewarding job knowing that I can play a part in shaping the landscape of Singapore. NTU Civil Engineering programme covers a wide range of civil engineering fields, ranging from Structural Engineering to Geotechnical Engineering, to Transportation Engineering and Environmental Engineering.  This allows graduates to embark into their interested field of civil engineering upon graduation. The contents covered in NTU Civil Engineering are practical and relevant to the real-life applications. I get to apply the knowledge and skills that I have acquired into practical uses in my job as a design engineer. The best memories of my time in NTU Civil Engineering would be the friendships that I have made at NTU. The times where we studied and worked on projects together, to joining various activities to have fun in. Even after we have graduated and joined various sectors of the Built Environment industry (e.g., government agencies, developers, consultants, contractors), we remain in close contact with each other. To potential applicants, a career in the Built Environment Industry is not dull but exciting and fulfilling. Do reach out to the professors, staffs, and seniors in NTU CEE to find out more about the course. To existing students, never stop learning and continue to expand your knowledge and skills through various avenues such as internships, seminar events, workshops, and webinars. See you around in the Built Environment industry! Bryan Goh (Bachelor of Civil Engineering, Class of 2020) Executive Engineer, RSP Architects Planners & Engineers (Pte) Ltd (RSP) Civil Engineering has become more than just mixing concrete and digging up earth. Nowadays, civil engineering projects employ robotics and modelling software.   What made you pursue this career? I aspire to change the perception of the Built Environment sector and inject a fresh perspective for our future engineers. This sector is undergoing transformation and without the human factor, no amount of new technologies and digital revolutions will ensure its success. I hope to have the opportunity to shape the future direction and help young engineers navigate the early years of their career in this sector. What are your main responsibilities? As the Production Planning Engineer at Soilbuild’s Integrated Construction and Prefabrication Hub  (ICPH), my main responsibilities include managing the integrated Enterprise Resource Planning system. The system drives various automation processes including the development and integration of emerging cutting-edge technologies to boost precast production efficiency and productivity. I am also involved in other facets of the business including research and development initiatives in advanced Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) solutions and sustainable green materials,  tender and project feasibility discussions, and strategic communications with industry partners,  government agencies and Institutes of Higher Learning. What is needed to be successful in this role? The transformation journey is challenging but an exciting one. Aspiring engineers should have an open mind and ride on the current wave of transformation to discover new opportunities that will provide them with a meaningful and rewarding career. Be aware that knowledge learnt from the classroom is very different from skills needed in an actual work environment. Strive to be a leader in your own capacity and be the catalyst for change. The industry does not need another engineer who simply works 9 to 5, it needs an engineer who can also think like a doctor, banker, lawyer, and analyst. What do you enjoy most about this role? This role provided me with hands-on experiences that covered many aspects of the Built Environment sector. Through interaction and collaboration with different stakeholders, I am exposed to a wide array of knowledge which cannot be learnt in a classroom. My work experiences have helped me better understand the industry as a whole, and in particular, how current practices in construction and prefabrication works can be improved. The steep learning curve is something that I have embraced positively and this mindset has helped develop me both as an engineer and as a leader. Share your advice with students who are keen to pursue a career in built environment. With the sector undergoing transformation and with fresh blood coming in with new perspectives, one needs to be mindful when working with seasoned colleagues who may be used to more conventional approaches. My advice is to always stay humble and courteous, and to always think of the bigger picture. Recognise the importance of teamwork. As with many other industries, managing good relationships with colleagues and business partners is important and will require one to have a sense of maturity and tenacity.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student The guaranteed overseas exchange opportunity with Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands was what attracted third-year student Arthur Mun to NTU’s maritime studies programme. Last semester, in the midst of a pandemic, he became one of the first students to take part in a remote exchange instead.  “We were supposed to spend at least a semester there in our third year, something students from other universities have to fight for. Unfortunately, we cannot be in the Netherlands now due to COVID-19, but I’m very thankful that we can still take the modules,” he says.  The suspension of overseas exchange may have put a damper on going overseas as part of the NTU experience, but students who want to do courses not offered at NTU can still take virtual classes at about 24 partner universities worldwide. “The Dutch professors teach quite differently from what we are used to here in Singapore. We also heard from veteran industry professionals, who spoke to us in small breakout rooms of six or less on Zoom. I don’t think my seniors got to engage these seasoned experts in pre-pandemic Netherlands,” adds Arthur.  Credit: Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands  Apart from virtual classes held entirely on Zoom, Arthur and his classmates participated in a shipping simulation as part of the curriculum. The students played shipping moguls who had to decide what fleets to purchase or sell, how to expand their shipping routes and what financial steps to take to stay afloat.  “The simulation was a small way in which the virtual experience was made even more special for us. Not only did we have to work around actual market prices, we had to make the call before prices changed, just as in the real world,” he says.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/gain-an-international-perspective'}, IndexData{title='About Convocation | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student   Class Plaque   The tradition of the Class Plaque was started by the graduating class of 2005. They have also begun a tradition of making a donation to the University endowment to benefit future generations of students of the University. To commemorate their graduation, a class plaque, to remain in perpetuity, will be placed in the University Quadrangle by student leaders after the first Convocation ceremony. A ring of class plaques, from past, present and future graduates, will eventually be a central feature of the University Quadrangle. NTU Mace   The NTU mace was commissioned in 1991 at a cost of $100,000 for use at ceremonial occasions which are attended and presided by the Chancellor. It was used for the first time at the Convocation ceremony held on 5 August 1992. The Design Technology Transfer Centre of Temasek Polytechnic both designed and fabricated the finished product from 32 components which, after the addition of the separately minted insignia or engraving, are plated with 22ct gold. The surfaces of the mace are generally of bright polished gold and are of different shades while some areas are matt polished to give emphasis to the design. The entire mace measures 1,110mm and weighs 11kg. Four heraldic lions surround a sphere at the head of the mace identifying the University as an institution within the Republic of Singapore. Beneath the head of the mace is found the coat of arms of the University in low relief, repeated four times on prominent facets. Between the head and the stem are two rings: one engraved with the University's title and the other, a broad grooved ring of jade to contrast with the glittering gold surfaces. A tapered staff connects the head to the base which incorporates the University's seal and echoes the faceted form of the head.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Double major Provided by The Double Major Programme is a four-year direct honours degree programme. Undergraduate students will read two majors chosen from among the disciplinary strengths of the four schools in the College, namely, the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), the School of Humanities (SoH), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). Unlike the existing single discipline-based degrees, this degree will feature two distinct majors within an innovative new structure. As such this is a fully conceived double-disciplinary degree. Students will be admitted into this Double Major degree programme at the point of entry to NTU, and declare their two majors at this point. During this four-year degree programme, undergraduates will read both Economics and Public Policy and Global Affairs, benefiting from the expertise and resources of both programmes from the School of Social Sciences(SSS). The Economics curriculum offers opportunities to pursue specializations in both the traditional, as well as contemporary areas such as micro- and macro-economics, growth and development, labour economics, financial economics, environmental economics, health economics and behavioural economics. The Public Policy and Global Affairs curriculum focuses on public administration, public policy, Singapore politics and government, public organisation and management, comparative public administration, government budgeting and financial management, human resource management, international relations, public service ethics, and programme evaluation. The aim is to provide students with a general understanding of and exposure to the field of Public Administration and Public Policy.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student FlexiMasters: Why is it for me? Lifelong learning does not need to be intimidating. Adult learners juggling work and life can take charge of the learning pace and pathways with NTU’s FlexiMasters, which are short-term modular courses that can be stacked to obtain a full master’s degree. Text: Junn Loh 1. You can test the water before taking the plunge We get it. Going back to school after some time in the workforce is a huge commitment, especially when you may not be sure that what you’ve signed up for is truly to your liking. This is why it is beneficial to enrol in a programme that gives you the space to adjust to studying, and the flexibility to walk away in the event it’s ill-suited for your needs. “It was a good dipstick for me to find out if I could manage my time and prepare for my studies, while keeping different learning pathways open,” said Tan Sini, an Educator at Singapore’s Ministry of Education who completed a FlexiMasters in Learning and Development. “If the workload of the courses is manageable, there is a flexibility to continue completing FlexiMasters or to opt for a credit transfer to progress to the related master’s programme,” she said. Malcolm Toh pursued courses in Supply Chain Engineering with a view on working towards a master's degree in the future. Malcolm Toh was similarly drawn to the stackable nature of FlexiMasters. “This aspect allows me to have a flavour of NTU postgraduate courses and enjoy the flexibility of pursuing an NTU master’s degree at a later stage,” said the Senior Procurement Executive who pursued courses stackable to a FlexiMasters in Supply Chain Engineering. 2. It won’t break the bank A big part of becoming a working adult is paying the bills. With rising costs, paying for continuous learning may not be your priority. Thankfully, NTU’s FlexiMasters courses are highly subsidised, so you won’t have to break the bank just to upskill yourself. Liang Jia Cheng, who completed a FlexiMasters in Materials Science and Engineering, said: “The courses are eligible for SkillsFuture Singapore funding, which relieves my financial concerns.” The deal is made sweeter if you are an alumnus of NTU, as you can utilise alumni course credits. “As I was forking out money for my continuing education, the NTU alumni course credits, worth S$1,600, provided financial support in offsetting my courses fees, which greatly helped in reducing my financial burden,” said Ng You Pin, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree from NTU’s School of Materials Science and Engineering and went on to pursue courses stackable to FlexiMasters in Supply Chain Engineering. 3. It’s an opportunity to build your community and network In a FlexiMasters programme, chances are you will be surrounded by classmates who are working in a similar industry as you or share a similar growth mindset. This makes it a great opportunity to build a supportive community and to grow your network. “I had the chance to collaborate with fellow learners from diverse backgrounds, engaging in discussions, group projects, and peer-to-peer learning. This not only broadened my perspectives but also facilitated networking and the exchange of ideas,” said Kristin Tan, who completed a FlexiMasters in Supply Chain Engineering. 4. You won't be bored Don’t expect to bury yourself in journal papers and textbooks. Taught by industry experts, the FlexiMasters courses are designed to help learners gain practical and industry relevant skills to thrive in their careers. (Left) Apart from the knowledge gained from her course, Matilda Huang learned from her coursemates and lecturers, who shared their experiences openly and willingly. (Right) Abdul Halim was surprised to find out how fun and relatable classes were. Abdul Halim, who enrolled in a FlexiMasters in Project Management, said: “I was expecting a dull learning experience with heavy academic expectations. However, I had fun surprisingly. The lecturers were encouraging and knowledgeable. They shared their work experience during classes which made the learning seamless and relatable for working adults like me." Matilda Huang, who attended a FlexiMasters in Early Childhood Education, was also worried about “not being able to fully digest academic journals”, and if her contributions in class were “not good enough”. However, her worries were put to rest when she realised that her coursemates were welcoming and generous in sharing their knowledge. “Most of them were much more experienced than me and were very happy to share their knowledge and experience. This has been my biggest takeaway – learning from the experiences of my lecturers and fellow coursemates,” she said. 5. It will expand competencies for career development In a constantly changing world, updating yourself with the latest competencies is key to remaining relevant. This was the case for engineer Chia Jie Xiang, who was motivated to sign up for a FlexiMasters in Power Engineering to gain knowledge beyond his main specialisation at work. “The course has taught me how to inspect issues from an electrical engineering standpoint instead of from a purely mechanical angle. This has allowed me to gain a macro perspective, aiding my research projects at work,” Jie Xiang explained. For human resources (HR) practitioner Jacqueline Ng, the business centric nature of the FlexiMasters in HR Thought Leadership helped bridge the gap in her knowledge and competencies.   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/fleximasters-why-is-it-for-me'}, IndexData{title='Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Double Major - Psychology and Linguistics & Multilingual Studies | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Student entrepreneur Isaiah is pursuing a double major in English Literature and Art History. The interdisciplinary nature of his degree has enriched his learning journey by opening up diverse experiences and opportunities, and motivated him to set up The CreativeWerkz.  I chose to read a Double Major in English Literature and Art History at NTU because I had previously written my H3 Literature in English research paper in Junior College on the feminisation of Asian mythology and spent time in the collections of the Asian Civilisation Museum and National Gallery Singapore. This led me to develop a keen interest in interdisciplinary research in the arts and humanities, drawing novel approaches to studying and creating projects that look at the revitalisation of pre-modern Southeast Asian art histories and literatures. I considered, applied and was accepted into similar Joint Honours programmes at the University of York, University of Birmingham, and University of Bristol. However, I was drawn to NTU because of the diversity in its wide course offerings which cover subjects from classical global art histories to innovative forerunners such as Literature and Medicine. Specialising in Southeast Asian art histories, literatures and performance theories while pursuing a career in arts entrepreneurship and education excites me because of how new this field is in Southeast Asia. No one day is the same and the potential to explore new approaches to art making while being able to find and use opportunities to impart this knowledge to the next generation of students, artists, historians and scholars is what motivates me. As a student in the NTU School of Humanities, I have been given the opportunity to interact with high profile gallerists, artists, curators and scholars within and beyond my field, allowing me to forge ties with industry professionals for current and future collaborations. I was also given the space to explore my ideas through creative projects and discussions, some of which were expanded into projects beyond the classroom. As part of the programme and the larger NTU family, I honed my interpersonal skills especially when dealing with clients beyond my immediate circle of influence, independence in working and collaborating with others and most importantly, I have learnt how to think critically outside the box in order to find solutions to real world problems when it comes to my career. Although I did not go for an exchange programme, I was partially funded to travel to Indonesia and Thailand for my dissertation research on modern Indonesian painting and dramatic literature. This gave me first-hand experience in gathering primary research data in the humanities in a foreign language which I was able to translate for my final paper. Half of my university education happened during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This ran alongside the development of my career in arts, business and education. As such, both my educational and professional experience moved me to adapt to new ways of teaching, communication and administration. Particularly, the shift to online learning and changing the ways in which we assess students was a major change that turned out to be rather beneficial in changing the education business landscape. My degree opens up young and emerging networks among individuals and groups of diverse interests (business, arts, modern languages, and curation just to name a few), introduces me to different career pathways that could be possible in the future, and gave me opportunities to work alongside passionate students and faculty to develop curatorial projects (SCCC ReMix 2022 Open Call), arts productions (Single Mothers, Anamnesis, The Concubine) and research stints (Centre 42 Arts Research Residency). I set up The CreativeWerkz primarily out of passion and need; passion for arts and education, need because I noticed many freelance designers and artists requiring opportunities to learn and create in a safe, inclusive and forward-thinking environment. As such, I try to involve as many creatives as possible in each project that I take on. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my degree, I am taught and motivated to think out of the box, not necessarily conforming to pre-existing paths when it comes to problem solving and spearheading business ventures and projects. I also tend to use the skills I have acquired in art history (visual literacy, creative enterprise, analysis and research, consolidation and data collection) and literature (critical reading, synthesis of data, reading against the grain) when curating pedagogies and curricula for potential clients. An entrepreneur should be passionate, self-driven, humble and most of all, adaptable. A company that is constantly resistant to change cannot prosper in the long run especially given that we live in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world that needs to evolve in order to develop. Problem-solving, being creative, daring to take calculated risks and continue to grow in terms of developing digital literacy and skills also prove to be indispensable skills that I have learnt to embrace as an entrepreneur. The CreativeWerkz, being run by a founder who is trained both as a classical art historian and literary critic with over 15 years of performing arts and teaching experience, offers educational programmes (Drama-in-Curriculum, assembly shows, and contract teaching programmes) that cater to a wide range of clients. Regardless of need, we are able to provide both graphic design and educational services that marry aesthetics and effectiveness of pedagogy. Unlike conventional education and design companies, my team and I include innovative teaching practices and a diverse offering when it comes to both small and large-scale event planning, design and execution.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/spearheading-a-business-venture'}, IndexData{title='Day of Ceremony | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

The Programme looks out for candidates with strong critical thinking and writing skills. There is no single subject that gives you these skills: you can develop them by studying biology, chemistry, economics, geography, history, language, literature, mathematics, physics, etc – any subject that requires you to think through the material and write about it. In addition, we regard an active interest in current affairs, both within Singapore and internationally, as essential in a Sociology applicant. You need to meet NTU’s general admission requirements, and a good Polytechnic diploma OR strong ‘A’ levels (including a good pass in GP or K&I). If you are a Polytechnic candidate, you’ll need to have at least a pass in GCE ’O’ Level English Language and your other GCE ‘O’ level subjects may be considered. Applicants are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and the division also interviews and administers writing tests for select candidates. Students must satisfy the basic requirements for admission into NTU. 1) For GCE 'A' level Holders A good grade in General Paper/Knowledge & Inquiry 2) For Local Polytechnic Diploma Holders Application is opened to all local Polytechnic Diploma holders regardless of the diploma obtained. The curriculum provides an intellectually stimulating and rigorous experience for students. The academic foundation consists of three core areas: Economy, Technology and Society; Culture, Self and Identity; and Organisations and Organisational Change. It provides both breadth of exposure and depth of engagement that emphasizes both theoretical reasoning and empirical analysis. Students should graduate with not just a body of knowledge and skills but also a 'sociological imagination' that will enable them to make the critical and creative difference in the workplace and in society.  Key features of our programme include:   Stimulating courses, providing both breadth of exposure and depth of engagement Immersion in all core substantive areas and research methodologies Training and practice in analytical thinking and empirical reasoning Informed investigations of Singapore society, Asian societies, and beyond Critical perspectives on social change at the local, regional, and global levels.                                                                                       Curriculum Structure Total (AUs) Core​ The requirements for a Sociology major consist of 3 components: 1.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Winning recognition overseas These communication undergrads took part in a global competition as a class project in integrated platform advertising and ended the term as world champions, with US$1,000 and US$500 in prize money. For the six students, Nurfatin Rahim, Janessa Tan, Tiffany Chee, Abner Chong, Charmaine Goh and Sejal Bagaria, the odds were stacked against them as they were taking part in a United States-based competition dominated by American varsity teams. However, the NTU students, who formed two teams of three students each, took home the first and second prize at the Digital Marketing Competition organised by weight loss company Wondr Health in December last year. “We had little understanding of the consumer markets outside Singapore, but we used Reddit and Twitter to gather opinions and attitudes of American consumers on various weight loss programmes,” reveals Janessa, who is from the champion team. Her team also took home the Data-Driven Award as the judges recognised the value of their well-researched pitch. The win wouldn’t have been possible, say the undergrads, without the perks of an NTU education. “Our class lecturer, Ms Wong Pei Wen, invited numerous top-level executives from Google and TikTok to show us the inner workings of their business, including how advertising buys actually work. In addition to these guest lecturers, we were also directly mentored by an associate director at a media buying agency,” recalls Charmaine. “Nothing beats learning from the industry giants themselves. I can confidently say I picked up programmatic advertising from Google – and this is going to make my CV stand out,” adds Sejal. The in-depth insights and direct mentorship made a huge difference to the way both teams crafted their campaign strategy for the competition, they reveal. “We sent our ideas and presentations to the industry experts for their feedback, and I remember learning a lot from their comments and criticisms. Education doesn’t get more ‘real’ than that!” laughs Nurfatin. Sejal agrees: “Our group sent them a long list of questions, which they so patiently answered in detail.” More than just award-winning advice from top executives, the students also got an authentic look at advertising as a career, both the positives and downsides, says Abner.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/lessons-from-top-level-industry-experts'}, IndexData{title='Disclaimer | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student   Q: My child is keen to take a degree in artificial intelligence (AI), but I’m concerned about the speed at which the technology is advancing. Will his degree still be relevant after he graduates? AI is evolving at a staggering pace and could impact over 300 million jobs worldwide, says a 2023 report by US-based investment bank Goldman Sachs. However, new jobs will also be created. Some of the fastest-growing roles include AI and machine learning specialists, says the World Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs report. A degree that lays a strong foundation in AI and data science will enable students to thrive in an AI-driven world, says Professor Ho Teck Hua, president of Nanyang Technological University (NTU). But they will have to continually build on their technical skills to keep pace with the relentless speed of innovation, says Prof Ho, who is also the founding executive chairman of AI Singapore, a national AI research and innovation programme. Launched in 2017, AI Singapore brings together local research institutions and AI start-ups and companies to deepen AI capabilities in the country. “Your AI degree will continue to be relevant as long as you are willing to learn new things,” Prof Ho says. “It provides a strong foundation that enables you to harness emerging technologies to create impactful solutions that address pain points faced by businesses, organisations, and society.” At NTU’s new College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) , students can choose from a range of AI and computing degree programmes, where they will work on real-life data and learn how to use AI to tackle real-world challenges. Through its Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core (ICC) curriculum, NTU also equips students with key foundational skills such as creativity and critical thinking, and knowledge of global trends and challenges, including in areas of sustainability and digitalisation. The seven ICC modules are mandatory for all undergraduates. The ICC curriculum is designed to spark curiosity and nurture an appetite for lifelong learning, explains Prof Ho. “These mindsets will be crucial in helping them to keep up with the demands of a rapidly evolving world and economy.” NTU’s CCDS has also been developing industry-relevant continuing education and training (CET) courses in AI, data science, and computing for its graduates. It aims to ramp up CET efforts by 30 per cent each year, Prof Ho says. The future is bright for graduates in AI, as the industry is expected to continue growing in the next five to 10 years, says Professor Ho Teck Hua, president of NTU. PHOTO: NTU Q: What does a degree in AI entail? Is it just about creating AI models? NTU’s CCDS offers two AI-related degree programmes: The newly launched Bachelor in AI and Society – the first of its kind in Singapore –  and the Bachelor in Data Science and AI. In these programmes, building AI models is just the tip of the iceberg, Prof Ho says. Students will learn how to apply the model they have built into a real-life AI solution that is powerful and human-centric. He adds: “Students will also get the opportunity to dive deeper into a few domains they are passionate about and create an AI solution that is tailored to those domains.” In the AI and Society degree programme, the focus on deep technical expertise is complemented with an understanding of the potential misuse of AI. “We want to nurture AI scientists who will design and build AI systems that are human-centric,” explains Prof Ho. “This starts with helping students understand how AI systems and people can collaborate, with the ultimate goal of significantly improving human potential.” Practical learning is a key component of the programme. Students go on a 20-week mandatory internship, where they learn how to apply AI concepts and techniques to innovate and address real-world challenges. Through group design and capstone projects, they get to create and develop an AI solution that benefits a sector of their choice. " We want to nurture AI scientists who will design and build AI systems that are human-centric. This starts with helping students understand how AI systems and people can collaborate, with the ultimate goal of significantly improving human potential. " PROFESSOR HO TECK HUA, president of Nanyang Technological University “Those who are keen to dive deep into the world of AI can apply for our new Turing AI Scholars Programme, which is open to students enrolled in the AI and Society, Data Science and AI, and Computer Science programmes,” Prof Ho says. Scholars in the programme can learn from AI experts across academia and industry through exclusive masterclasses and research opportunities. They can also look forward to overseas internships and study exchanges at leading global universities. Q: What are his career prospects with a degree in AI? The AI industry is expected to continue growing in the next five to 10 years, as AI becomes a general-purpose technology, says Prof Ho. “This means the future is bright for graduates in AI.” The latest Joint Autonomous Universities Graduate Employment Survey results show that fresh graduates who work in information and digital technologies continue to draw one of the highest starting salaries among their peers. NTU’s AI-related degrees will open the doors to coveted roles such as AI engineers and scientists. “The career prospects will be good, and the sector will pay well. But you will have to be curious and persistent because the world is rapidly changing,” says Prof Ho. To get the most out of the degree programme, he encourages students to keep an open mind. “AI can be a springboard for the next wave of interesting start-ups. You could become the founder of a new kind of business that was previously not possible without AI technologies.” In partnership with Nanyang Technological University     National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/does-it-make-sense-to-take-an-ai-related-degree-given-the-rapid-technological-changes'}, IndexData{title='Humanities, arts and social sciences | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Making masterpieces from moments The impact of his work within and beyond our shores has made Nanyang Alumni Achievement Award 2023 recipient, Kevin Lim (WKWSCI/2009), a decorated photojournalist, but it’s his desire to tell the truth with pictures that drives him on. Text: Derek Rodriguez / Photos: Kevin Lim The highlight of his personal life is meeting his wife, NTU alumna Neo Xiaobin, in the newsroom. “She is my constant source of inspiration and my pillar of strength. The life-changing part was when I became a father to our two lovely little boys, Kiran and Kayen. They are my constant reminder that we only live once, and I’ll loathe to miss their milestones and moments growing up,” says Kevin. Even if you don’t recognise Kevin Lim by his name, you would have seen his photos in major publications in Singapore and around the world. The chief photojournalist of The Straits Times at Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) has covered global events such as the aftermath and devastation brought about by Typhoon Haiyan in Tacloban, Philippines, and the 2016 Olympics in Rio, where he captured the swansongs of sporting legends Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps, as well as Olympic swimmer Joseph Schooling’s historic win. Capturing the ebb and flow of an athlete’s career at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Kevin returned with shots of Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps in their final competitive races, and of Joseph Schooling (above) picking up Singapore’s first ever Olympic gold medal. (Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited. Permission required for reproduction) He was also the only Singapore photojournalist to cover the Trump-Kim summit at Capella Hotel Singapore in 2018. Not only was one of his photos used on a cover of Time magazine, another one showing the backs of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then-US President Donald Trump was named in Time’s 100 Photos of the Year list. Kevin’s photo featured on the cover of Time. The photo taken by Kevin that was in Time’s 100 Photos of the Year in 2018. He says: “This picture summed up the event for me. These two world leaders came to Singapore with the hope of working towards denuclearisation. They came, shook hands but when they left and we saw the back of them, I wondered what had really been achieved.” In the same year, Kevin created a bit of history for himself by clinching SPH’s Journalist of the Year award, a first for a photojournalist. For Kevin, however, awards are just a bonus. What truly motivates him is the need to produce quality work. He explains: “I hold journalism ethics close to my heart. To be accountable, ethical and accurate in what I present when it comes to reportage. At the end of the day, both in my career and personal life, I want to be able to look back and know that I have given my all, thoroughly enjoyed the process, and have no regrets.” NTU through Kevin’s lenses It has been 14 years since Kevin graduated from NTU. From time to time, his work takes him in the vicinity of the campus, which he takes as opportunities to visit his alma mater. “I still reminisce about my days as an undergraduate living in hall, and I revisit that by exploring the various food options for a quick meal between assignments. Earlier this year, I dropped by the North Hill halls for mala at A Hot Hideout. It had a long queue, so I had mala at the food court instead. But it’s not about the food, it’s about being back on campus and allowing myself to go back in time a bit, escaping reality for a short while,” says Kevin. Corridor to the Nanyang Chronicle headquarters “Joining the now defunct Nanyang Chronicle back in 2005 as a freshman was key to where I am today. I had no experience with a camera prior to that. Even though the learning curve was steep, the process of learning how I can tell stories through visuals piqued my interest enough to want to develop further.” A familiar view “The experience with the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information’s Go-Far programme (a journalism module that takes students on assignment overseas) in Karnataka in India, where we reported on issues like farmer suicides, reaffirmed my desire to embark on a career in photojournalism.” Cultivating creativity     Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/making-masterpieces-from-moments'}, IndexData{title='2020 Forbes 30 under 30 – Jia Cai Lau | Nanyang Business School | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

We encourage them to nurture their passion to make a difference. Our Initiatives Part of our Nanyang Business School Orientation Programme, Inflammaré ignites a strong passion for corporate social responsibility among our undergraduates in their freshman year. Every year, the Inflammaré   team comes up with projects and ideas to meld the dynamic energy of our freshmen into a real desire to serve a greater purpose  – the community.   In 2020, they held a Storybooks & Games Donation Drive for Gracehaven, a residential home run by the Salvation Army for children and youths requiring care, protection, and rehabilitation. In just a fortnight, more than 300 books were collected, plus card games and board games, and given to the delighted children and youths at Gracehaven. Christmas Angels is a charitable project run by Nanyang Business School’s Actuarial Science Club (ASC), with the aim of bringing joy and happiness to underprivileged children in Singapore. In 2020, ASC partnered with Children’s Wishing Well to inspire the general public to sponsor Christmas gifts for children. Together, they sourced the gifts, which cost no more than $30, and coordinated with our students and staff to help spread the word.   Will you please read with me?

Fundraising Campaign for Breast Cancer Foundation The High Heels Challenge is an event co-organised by NTU MBA Student Executive Committee and Women-in-Business Club, to kick-off the Singapore MBA Dean’s Challenge 2021 while coinciding with International Women’s Day (IWD). The event runs as an awareness campaign through a team relay race challenge, with 45 participants from NTU, NUS and SMU competing to be the fastest team in a 4 x 50m race wearing high heels. All proceeds raised through the campaign were donated to the Singapore Breast Cancer Foundation. I survived Covid-19, now I want to help others through tough times Tough times don’t last. Tough people do. #NBSAlumna, Li Mei (Class of 2014), not only battled the dreaded Coronavirus, but co-founded a ground-up movement called #KampungKakis with inspiration from her own life experience. #KampungKakis is a neighbourhood buddy system to support the elderly and low-income families. Kampong living… in Kazakhstan An architect with a Master’s in business, NBS alumna Renee How (Class of 2010) is now a farmer. Driven by her desire to offer local farmers a solution to poor harvests caused by harsh weather conditions, she relocated to Kazakhstan to manage the country’s first aquaponics greenhouse. Rebekah Lin and Cheryl Chong: Forces of Change “We’ve been volunteering and doing our projects individually and we decided to do something to challenge the myth that youths today do not care about the community,” Rebekah Lin (left) and Cheryl Chong founded The Social Co to create a movement of positive social impact by young people Spread the joy of reading I think that the event was a meaningful one because we get to give the students from lower-income or those who are less fortunate books to read... Cheer up kids I am sure the books and board games donated will be of great help and cheer up a lot of the kids who need them more... Art for Heart’s Sake In 2019, NTU NBS Alumni Association and Very Special Arts (VSA) Singapore jointly presented Art for Heart’s Sake, an art jamming workshop led by differently-abled artists.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Through a better understanding of environmental issues and political science, Terese Teoh hopes to devise policies that mitigate ecological damage while protecting vulnerable communities. NTU ASE's Environmental Earth Systems Science and Public Policy (ESPP) double major programme was the only programme I had applied to for university. The combination of political science and environmental science immediately struck a chord with me, and I didn't see myself fitting into any of the other programmes in other local universities. Throughout my three years of education, my perspectives on the environment have matured, from once being fiery and single-minded to a more nuanced and open-minded one. Studying environmental science reminds me of the complexity of ecosystem interactions and the many knock-on effects, for example, which warns us against developing policies independent of other considerations. On the other hand, political science has taught me how to think from different perspectives at the individual, local, national and international levels. Throughout my years of study, the concept of environmental justice has grown close to my heart. To me, environmental protection involves designing good policies that regulate or limit ecological damage, but also ensure that these policies do not cause undue harm to people, particularly those from vulnerable communities. So perhaps it's unsurprising that I particularly enjoy the modules that draw an intersection between policy and the environment. I also try to make that link when the modules aren't explicitly related, such as when we have a freedom of topic choice in projects-based assignments. I am also grateful that my university education has refined my presentation and communication skills in expressing my passion and ideas, as I used to struggle with that a lot more. In my second year, I took a module in environmental law, after presenting on how environmental legislation is formed at the highest levels in intergovernmental organisations, I became hooked on the topic. I am also grateful for the many field trips I attended as part of my environmental science course, which has made learning a lot more memorable and fun. I also enjoy attending Prof Hsuan's classes, as she designs lessons in interesting ways that make students genuinely want to learn. I don't feel like I'm studying in her classes, and I'm excited to come to class. My education at NTU has helped me see environmental issues from a more multi-dimensional perspective, which has supported me in other civil society work outside of school. To my juniors out there considering this double major programme, if you’re captivated by the intersection of environment and global affairs, I encourage you all to join the programme and uncover the answers to your questions.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/making-a-case-for-environmental-justice'}, IndexData{title='Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Changi water plant undergoes its third expansion to address rising industrial demand in eastern Singapore The Straits Times reports on the expansion of the Changi Water Reclamation Plant to meet increasing industrial demand in the eastern part of Singapore and ensuring a sustainable used water system for Singapore.  The plant's current water treatment capacity is 224 million gallons per day. It is undergroing its second expansion, which is slated for completion by end-2024 and its total capacity will be 246 million gallons a day. This expansion marks the third phase of development for the plant, which will raise its water treatment capacity by up to 96 million gallons a day. Advanced membrane bioreactor technology which is more sustainable water treatment process will be incorporated in this third expansion of the Changi plant. This technology also produces better-quality treated used water for Newater production. As at 2023, Singapore’s daily water consumption is about 440 million gallons. Water demand is expected to almost double by 2065, of which two-thirds are projected to come from non-domestic sectors. Emeritus Professor Ng Wun Jern of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) said: “Industry demand for water is expected to increase, such as from the anticipated electronics industry expansion, and the latter shall largely be met with Newater.” The Changi Water Reclamation Plant treats wastewater, which is then purified at Newater factories through reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light to eliminate viruses and bacteria. Newater is mainly used for industrial cooling and at wafer fabrication plants, industrial estates, and commercial buildings. During dry periods, Newater is blended into Singapore’s reservoirs for further treatment before domestic use. Commissioned in 2008, Changi’s reclamation plant currently hosts two Newater factories, established in 2010 and 2017 respectively. Construction of a third factory will begin in late 2024 after an environmental assessment ensuring no marine impact from its discharge. Scheduled for completion in 2026, the new factory will receive treated wastewater from Changi and produce up to 50 million gallons of Newater daily, matching the combined output of the existing factories. Associate Professor Darren Sun Delai from NTU’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering emphasized the importance of water reclamation plants in Singapore. These plants prevent treated wastewater from being wasted and reduce dependence on Singapore's other water sources: rainwater captured through waterways and reservoirs, imported water from Malaysia, and desalinated water. With projected increases in population and tourism, wastewater generation is expected to rise significantly. Prof. Sun highlighted that water reclamation is more cost-effective than desalination, with Newater factories costing at least 30% less to operate. He noted that PUB (Public Utilities Board - Singapore's national water agency) has been at the forefront of innovation in Newater systems. Prof. Sun, also the founder of NanoSun, a spin-off from NTU specializing in 3D printing nano materials for water reclamation, mentioned that PUB’s advancements could potentially meet over 55% of Singapore’s water needs by 2060 at highly competitive rates.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, co-founder of Dawn Cups It can be difficult for women in Singapore to find environmentally sustainable alternatives to menstrual pads. That was our motivation to start a menstrual cup business. Our menstrual cups are made of medical grade silicone. With proper care, they can last for up to 10 years, making them eco-friendlier than single-use pads or tampons. Through Dawn Cups, we hope to empower women to learn more about their own bodies, help them make their periods more tolerable, and develop a supportive community where we can tackle the stigma surrounding periods together. A big thank you to… the Minor in Entrepreneurship programme in NTU. Our instructors were invaluable in helping us get our start-up off the ground as we could consult them whenever we needed advice navigating tricky situations. -Nila Ravichandran PRANAV GOVINDARAJ Computer Science, co-founder of CyberLife AI Our app helps hospitals increase productivity. Through chatbots and other assessment tools that patients use at home, doctors can ascertain if a patient needs a follow-up appointment without having to meet the patient in person. We are successfully piloting our app at Singapore’s National University Hospital and another hospital has expressed interest in our product. Hopefully, by 2024, we can get more hospitals in Singapore on board and also receive funding to further develop our app. A big thank you to… NTUitive’s Venture Building Programme for granting us $1,000 and for directing us to the right people to talk to. - Pranav Govindaraj REUBEN NGIAU Business, co-founder of Pawfoo My start-up turns surplus food such as unsold fruit or meat into tasty pet treats. We hope to establish Pawfoo in consumer’s minds as a sustainable pet snack company and are working on growing our customer base by collaborating with brands that share our sustainability mindset. We also plan to set up booths at various fairs around Singapore. A big thank you to… the NTU CoLab4Good fund, which provided our company with financial support for two years. The $10,000 helped us purchase equipment to further improve our production of nutritious pet treats, such as parfaits for dogs. - Rueben Ngiau MATTHIAS NGEO Computer Science, co-founder of Forus Labs If you need a secretary but can’t afford one, why not use an app? We realised the potential of productivity apps to help people improve their lives and decided to create a whole suite of them under Forus Labs. Our first app, TimeBloc, a scheduling app, achieved over 50,000 active monthly users in under a year. We sold it soon after that and are now working on Essential, a bundle of productivity and wellness apps that can help people to slow down and focus, create good daily habits and improve their mental wellbeing through journaling. Our hope is that Essential will surpass the record set by TimeBloc within the next three years. CRYSTAL SIM Accountancy and Business, co-founder of Jynsei It all began when my co-founders and I experimented with building our own customised mechanical keyboards. Word got out and we discovered that there was a growing demand for such services. That’s what inspired us to begin our start-up offering customised electronic products to university students. We aspire to have our own manufacturing process for customised electronic goods in two years’ time. It’s crucial that we have good control over the level of customisation we can provide. A big thank you to… all my peers who have tirelessly supported me from the start. My professors also provided great advice on marketing and entrepreneurship. NTU has opened many doors for us to receive start-up grants, such as those from NTUitive. - Crystal Sim PHILEON GOH Renaissance Engineering Programme, co-founder of OraHub Our goal is to help people take better care of their oral health, which is often overlooked. My co-founder and I developed an app powered by artificial intelligence that can identify potential oral health issues, such as plaque or tooth decay. We recently launched a line of electric toothbrushes and floss picks. With our app and oral care products, we hope to better educate university students on the importance of oral health. Further investments to improve our app and new oral care products are also in the pipeline. A big thank you to… NTU’s Lean LaunchPad programme for kickstarting our entrepreneurship journey, as well as mentors from NTUitive, the university’s innovation and enterprise company, for their support and advice. We also received financial help from Garage@EEE and NTUitive’s Multi-Disciplinary Team Project fund. - Phileon Goh JASLYN MUK Biological Sciences, co-founder of Hey, You Got Mail! The COVID-19 pandemic shone a light on social isolation, especially among the elderly. To accompany them through the circuit breaker, we thought about sending them personal handwritten cards. Every time a customer purchases a handmade card from us, we send another handwritten card to a senior citizen in a nursing home. We plan to develop more programmes to encourage young people to care for the elderly around them, starting with their own neighbours. Apart from our regular crocheting and card-writing sessions, we have physical befriending events where volunteers can interact with the seniors by teaching them useful digital skills.   National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-stories/bosses-in-the-classroom'}, IndexData{title='Frequently Asked Questions | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

However, this would be considered impractical plastic processing due to the slow rate of feeding and worm maintenance.  A team of scientists from NTU's School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) offered hope for a nature-inspired method to tackle the global plastic pollution problem. They have developed an artificial 'worm gut' that breaks down plastics which accelerates plastic biodegradation. NTU Associate Professor Cao Bin at the School of CEE and Principal Investigator at SCELSE said, “A single worm can only consume about a couple of milligrams of plastic in its lifetime, so imagine the number of worms that would be needed if we were to rely on them to process our plastic waste. Our method eliminates this need by removing the worm from the equation. We focus on boosting the useful microbes in the worm gut and building an artificial ‘worm gut’ that can efficiently break down plastics.” To create the plastic-digesting worm gut, the scientists fed three groups of super worms different plastic diets - High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS) - over 30 days. The control group was fed a diet of oatmeal. These plastics are selected as they are among the most common plastics used in everyday items like food boxes and detergent bottles. HDPE is a type of plastic known for its high-impact resistance, making it difficult to break down. After feeding the worms plastic, scientists extracted the microbiomes from their gut and incubated them in flasks containing synthetic nutrients and different types of plastics, forming an artificial ‘worm gut’. Over six weeks, the microbiomes were left to grow in the flasks at room temperature. The scientists found that compared to the control group, the flasks that contained the gut microbiomes from the plastic-fed worms showed a significant increase in plastic-degrading bacteria. Furthermore, the microbial communities colonizing the plastics in the flasks were simpler and more tailored to the specific type of plastic than the microbes found on plastics that had been fed directly to the worms.  When the microbial communities are simpler and targeted to a specific type of plastic, this translates to potential for more efficient plastic degradation when used in real-life applications. First author of the study Dr Liu Yinan, Research Fellow at the School of CEE and SCELSE, said, “Our study represents the first reported successful attempt to develop plastic-associated bacterial communities from gut microbiomes of plastic-fed worms. Through exposing the gut microbiomes to specific conditions, we were able to boost the abundance of plastic-degrading bacteria present in our artificial ‘worm gut,’ suggesting that our method is stable and replicable at scale.”     Related stories National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cee/news-events/news/detail/ntu-scientists-develops-artificial-'worm-gut'-that-breaks-down-plastics'}, IndexData{title='GAIN Distinguished Speaker Series - Dr Bicky Bhangu | Global Alliance of Industries @ NTU | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Held on 3 March 2022, the hybrid session was moderated by NTU Senior Vice President for Research Professor Lam Khin Yong and received a favourable response from participants.  During the session, Dr Bhangu touched on Rolls-Royce’s approach towards a sustainable future. The Group’s goal was clear – net-zero by 2050; it’s roadmap to get there even more so. The fight will be won through a bold vision, disruptive technologies, radical innovation, talent management, and meaningful collaborations. These are the tools wielded by Rolls-Royce as they lead the journey towards net-zero and strive to create a more sustainable aerospace industry.  Using technology as a key enabler, Rolls-Royce focuses on sustainable product creation. Though challenging to achieve, reducing fuel consumption, carbon emissions and noise are all considered paramount outcomes of their product development process. This strategy is accompanied by an increase in research and technology investment towards game-changing solutions that are sustainable.  Dr Bhangu also highlighted the importance of academic and industry collaborations in driving innovation – from ideation to commercialization –to bring impactful ideas into fruition. This cannot be achieved without talent and Dr Bhangu ended the session by sharing how Rolls-Royce values talent and their strategy for attracting and retaining these.  The Q&A session featured discussions on the role of artificial intelligence in achieving net-zero, the feasibility of using recycled materials in Rolls-Royce’s products, the role students can play in Rolls-Royce’s all-electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle plans and many more.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student ‘A window to an alien world’: Macro photographer’s quest may have led him to discover a new species Mr Nicky Bay was on a photography field trip in 2022 with his friends when he came across a “Singapore Tiger”. The animal, which he photographed and catalogued on his website, was a land-dwelling crustacean called a terrestrial isopod. Dr Lam Weng Ngai from NTU Asian School of the Environment said the isopod species that Mr Bay discovered is likely a new, undescribed one. “Unfortunately, formally describing new isopod species is rather difficult as there are very few isopod taxonomists (scientists that specialise in describing and classifying species) working in the region. Even some of the most popular and commonly circulated isopods in the pet trade are undescribed,” he said. Read the full article on The Straits Times here .

To reduce extra heat in the environment on an individual level, consider using fans or having the air-conditioning unit turned on only for short periods of time. With regards to urban planning, green spaces such as forests and parks as well as blue spaces such as lakes and rivers should be preserved, and where possible, increased in size and number, they said.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student President and Distinguished University Professor Professor Ho Teck Hua is the fifth President of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU), where he is a Distinguished University Professor. He is also the founding Executive Chairman of AI Singapore (AISG) and President of the Academy of Engineering, Singapore. Professor Ho is a prominent behavioural scientist with a PhD and a master's degree in decision sciences from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He also holds a master’s degree in computer and information sciences and a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering with first class honours, both from the National University of Singapore (NUS). Before joining NTU, Professor Ho served as Senior Deputy President and Provost (2018-2023) and Deputy President (Research and Technology) (2015-2018) at NUS. He was the first awardee (in 2015) of the Singapore National Research Foundation’s Returning Singaporean Scientists Scheme, for projects on “Solving Societal Challenges Using Data-Driven Decision Sciences”. In 2017, he spearheaded the creation of AISG, a national research and development programme on artificial intelligence (AI). Under his leadership, AISG launched multiple signature projects, such as the use of AI to address national challenges in healthcare and education, 100Experiments projects to catalyse the adoption of cutting-edge AI solutions in the industry, and the award-winning AI Apprenticeship Programme to build a pipeline of AI talent for Singapore. As the Provost of NUS, he was responsible for developing and enhancing NUS’s Lifelong Learning (NUS L3) Programme, which is a pathway for postgraduate and continuing education. He was also responsible for attracting young global and Singaporean talent to NUS via the Presidential Young Professorship Scheme and recruiting established faculty members, including a Nobel Prize awardee, to join the University to head research centres and high-level international programmes.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Having it all NTU’s Work Study Degree programme allows students to work and study at the same time with immersive work experiences ranging from seven to 20 weeks It may seem like one always has to choose between school or career, unless it is a part-time or short-stint course, but with the Work Study Degree programme (WSDeg), students can have the best of all worlds.  “Someone who has gone on this programme will have an edge over their peers because it’s almost like they have worked in the company for years,” Sabrina Chew, Assistant Director, Work-Integrated Education, Career & Attachment Office, Student & Academic Services Department at NTU shares. The NTU WSDeg programme allows participants to – literally – work and study at the same time. But unlike ad hoc internships, or part-time jobs, learning and growth outcomes are structured, and aligned with the schools. Immersive work experiences range from seven to 20 weeks at a time, and students are attached to one or two companies from their second to final year, where they do their capstone project under the guidance of a company-appointed lead. Plus, they do not just earn academic credits from their industry engagements, they also get extensive opportunities from the companies they worked with.  ‘I had a chance to learn and network with people in the industry as well as to apply and deepen my knowledge in the memory chips fabrication process.  I could better appreciate how the work was done.” said Final year student Ng Yong Jin explains.  “I get first-hand experience, so I feel that I’m optimising my time in the university through industry exposure.” added Yong Jin.  Credit: Ng Yong Jin And it is not just that. As WSDeg programme participants are with the company for a much longer period, they are able to build on their previous experiences and pick up where they had left off previously. “The first round of engagement with the company focused on training while the second session was more hands-on, so I get to apply what I’ve learnt,” Final Year student Lee Jian Hui explains. It does mean a willingness to commit, since it is not a short-term one-off commitment. “You need to be serious about your career,” Sabrina says. “Go for it if you are very certain that this is where you want to go,” Yong Jin agrees, “But if you want more flexibility, it may not be for you.” The rewards can be invaluable. “I feel like an employee and have become more confident now.” shares Year 3 student Zheng Yushu, who is currently with Shimadzu. Yushu’s supervisors had encouraged her throughout and empowered her to see her final year project through from start to finish, from managing the project to contacting suppliers for the materials she required – skills which she may not have picked up at this stage otherwise. “Imagine yourself as a sponge that absorbs all the knowledge during the internship!” she enthuses. “The advice and guidance that my supervisor provided definitely gave me a deeper insight and knowledge into this industry.” Credit: Zheng Yushu Jian Hui agrees. “My mentors have been very willing to guide me, and because they’re practitioners, it helps me be more industry-ready.” It could certainly be a springboard to bigger and better things. Jian Hui is looking forward to a potential stint at Sumitomo Seika’s Japanese HQ, while Yong Jin has landed a scholarship at Micron, the company he is attached to. Beyond these, another key takeaway is a life lesson. “Be daring and don’t be afraid to make mistakes!” Yushu advises.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Keeper of the peace Dr Muhammad Tito Karnavian’s (RSIS/2013) entire career has been dedicated to the security of his countrymen, from protecting neighbourhoods against crime to safeguarding Indonesia against terrorist attacks. Text: Jennifer Su and Charmian Leong Dr Muhammad Tito Karnavian S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies PhD / Class of 2013 Nanyang Distinguished Alumni Award 2021 Believing in destiny can be a powerful thing. Back in 1983, a young Tito Karnavian was deciding whether to pursue his undergraduate studies in international relations, accountancy or medicine, or join the army. He applied to three universities – and was accepted by all – but eventually chose military life. Photo: Ministry of Home Affairs, Republic of Indonesia “I was a very patriotic young man, so I chose the armed forces because back then it was the easiest way to become a governor of a province, which was my dream,” he explains. But his dream was abruptly diverted when, after three months in the military academy, he was deemed most suitable for police work. “I was shocked because the police force was my last choice,” he laughs. “It was not my dream, but I had to accept it. Luckily, I ended up topping my cohort at the police academy in 1987. So it must have been God’s destiny for me.” Dr Muhammad Tito wasn’t just the best in his class, he received the Outstanding Achievement Medal (Adhi Makayasa) from former Indonesia President Suharto. He also became the youngest police officer to obtain the rank of commissioner general, and also one of the youngest to become the Chief of the Indonesian National Police in 2016 at age 51. He was only chief for four years before he was appointed Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia in 2019, a role he continues to hold today. In 2020, he was conferred the Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang (Distinguished Service Order) by Singapore President Halimah Yacob for his role in strengthening bilateral ties between Singapore’s and Indonesia’s police forces. Dr Muhammad Tito does not shy from putting in the hard work. “I do my best at any task given to me because I don’t want to let down my commanding officers. My success also came from building networks and, most of all, my faith.”  Being able to lean on his faith has helped him through tough times. As the leader of the country’s National Counter-terrorism Agency (BNPT) as well as the head of Indonesia’s elite Densus 88 counter-terrorism squad in 2010, he helped in the successful hunts for Noordin Mohammad Top – then Indonesia’s most-wanted fugitive – and Azahari Husin, the man believed to be the mastermind behind the 2002 Bali bombings. Besides daily prayers, he says: “I also make time for my hobbies, such as swimming, diving and singing karaoke with my wife.” While work often takes him on the road, he “thinks of it as a holiday because I get to see new things, engage with people, and see the natural beauty of the country”. His devotion to his homeland is what led him to pursue his PhD in Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. He chose NTU not just because of Singapore’s proximity to Indonesia, but also for its curriculum. “I really admire Singapore’s strategy in building its human resources, because now it has one of the best education systems in the world,” he says. “NTU has helped me expand my mindset from one of a practitioner to a scientist. In addition to my empirical experience, it has enhanced my understanding of global challenges, political conflicts, and terrorism.”   Share: National Institute of Education 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616 Novena Campus 11 Mandalay Road, Singapore 308232 Tel: (65) 65138572 Get in touch ', URL='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/alumni/alumni-stories-news/detail/keeper-of-the-peace'}, IndexData{title='Applying for seeNTU | NTU Singapore', content='Privacy Notice This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student Is air quality in Asia getting worse?   A slew of extreme weather events have hit Asian countries of late, including heat waves across countries like India and Singapore, as well as the yellow dust filled skies over East Asia as sandstorms sweep through China. How much of what we’re seeing can be attributed to climate change and will conditions worsen in the upcoming months? Associate Professor Steve Yim from NTU Singapore’s Asian School of the Environment said when it comes to climate change, there’s about a 0.2 to 0.3 degree increase per decade as a mean and there’s extreme episodes – like a heatwave of over three days, caused by drier environment due to conditions such as El Nino. As climate change intensifies, when heatwaves happen, individuals can avoid or reduce outdoor activities, as heat exhaustion and heat stroke could occur for vulnerable people. Air pollution experienced in the last two weeks is due to the air sinking from the higher levels to the lower levels, suppressing rainfall and causing warmer weather.

It was used for the first time at the Convocation ceremony held on 5 August 1992. The entire mace measures 1,110mm and weighs 11kg; and created from 32 components which after the addition of the separately minted insignia or engraving, are plated with 22ct gold. The surfaces of the mace are generally of bright polished gold and are of different shades while some areas are matt polished to give emphasis to the design. Four heraldic lions surround a sphere at the head of the mace identifying the University as an institution within the Republic of Singapore. Beneath the head of the mace is found the coat of arms of the University in low relief, repeated four times on prominent facets. Between the head and the stem are two rings: one engraved with the University's title and the other, a broad grooved ring of jade to contrast with the glittering gold surfaces. A tapered staff connects the head to the base which incorporates the University's seal and echoes the faceted form of the head.

Prospective Student Current Student Alumni Academic Business Partner Prospective Student Prospective Student Current Student GAIN Industry Speaker Series - Motorola Mr David Lum, Director of Technical Pre-Sales Support, Motorola Solutions, Inc., on Motorola Solutions: Building Safer Cities and Communities For the Industry Speaker Series organised by the Global Alliance of Industries @ NTU (GAIN) on August 30th, 2021, we had Mr David Lum, Director of Technical Pre-Sales Support from Motorola Solutions as our guest. In the 90 min session, Mr Lum shared about Motorola’s current technology portfolio and target markets. He also talked about the company’s new strategic direction and how this will help both the government and industries thrive in the present and be future-ready.  The Motorola’s story in Singapore spans a period of more than 48 years. From its early days as a walkie-talkie cum cell phone provider to its current position as a market leader in mission-critical communications, we learned about the interesting industrial applications of communication devices and more importantly, how Motorola’s development has evolved in tandem with the needs of the country and various key industries.   The session ended with a lively Q & A session moderated by Dr Teh Lay Kuan.
