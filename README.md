# tertiary-trekker
# 1. Background
This application crawls and scrapes data from University websites in Singapore, parses their content and consolidates their information into an Elasticsearch database for searching. 
Document clustering may then be performed to allow for users to discover similar webpages between University websites.

This project aims to assist prospective University students by presenting course information in a consolidated manner to facilitate comparisons.

Made for NUS Orbital 2024.
